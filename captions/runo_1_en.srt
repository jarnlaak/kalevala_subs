1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,792
I am driven by my longing,

2
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:20,583
And my understanding urges

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:24,375
That I should commence my singing;

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,167
And begin my recitation.

5
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:31,958
I will sing the people's legends,

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,750
And the ballads of the nation.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,542
To my mouth the words are flowing,

8
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:43,333
And the words are gently falling,

9
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,125
Quickly as my tongue can shape them,

10
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,917
And between my teeth emerging.

11
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,708
Dearest friend, and much-loved brother,

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,500
Best beloved of all companions,

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,292
Come and let us sing together,

14
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:06,083
Let us now begin our converse,

15
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,875
Since at length we meet together,

16
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,667
From two widely sundered regions.

17
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:17,458
Rarely can we meet together,

18
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,250
Rarely one can meet the other,

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,042
In these dismal Northern regions,

20
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:28,833
In the dreary land of Pohja.

21
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,625
Let us clasp our hands together,

22
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,417
Let us interlock our fingers;

23
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:40,208
Let us sing a cheerful measure,

24
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:44,000
Let us use our best endeavours,

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,640
While our dear ones hearken to us,

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,280
And our loved ones are instructed,

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,920
While the young are standing round us,

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,560
Of the rising generation,

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,200
Let them learn the words of magic.

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,840
And recall our songs and legends,

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,480
Of the belt of Väinämöinen,

32
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,120
Of the forge of Ilmarinen,

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,760
And of Kaukomieli's sword-point,

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,400
And of Joukahainen's crossbow:

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,040
Of the utmost bounds of Pohja,

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,680
And of Kalevala's wide heathlands.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,320
These my father sang aforetime,

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,960
As he carved his hatchet's handle,

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,600
And my mother taught me likewise,

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,240
As she turned around her spindle,

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,880
When upon the floor, an infant,

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,520
At her knees she saw me tumbling,

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,160
As a helpless child, milk-bearded,

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,800
As a babe with mouth all milky.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,440
Tales about the Sampo failed not,

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,080
Nor the magic spells of Louhi.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,720
Old at length became the Sampo;

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,360
Louhi vanished with her magic;

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,000
Vipunen while singing perished;

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Lemminkainen in his follies.

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,120
There are many other legends;

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,680
Songs I learned of magic import;

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,240
Some beside the pathway gathered;

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,800
Others broken from the heather;

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Others wrested from the bushes;

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,920
Others taken from the saplings,

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,480
Gathered from the springing verdure,

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,040
Or collected from the by-ways,

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,600
As I passed along as herd-boy,

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,160
As a child in cattle pastures,

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,720
On the hillocks, rich in honey,

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,280
On the hills, for ever golden,

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,840
After Muurikki, the black one,

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,400
By the side of dappled Kimmo.

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,960
Then the Frost his songs recited,

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,520
And the rain its legends taught me;

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,080
Other songs the winds have wafted,

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,640
Or the ocean waves have drifted;

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,200
And their songs the birds have added,

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,760
And the magic spells the tree-tops.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,320
In a ball I bound them tightly;

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,880
And arranged them in a bundle;

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,440
On my little sledge I laid it,

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,000
On my sleigh I laid the bundle;

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,440
Home upon the sledge I brought it,

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
Then into the barn conveyed it;

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
In the storehouse loft I placed it,

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,760
In a little box of copper.

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,200
In the cold my song was resting,

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,640
Long remained in darkness hidden.

81
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,080
I must draw the songs from Coldness,

82
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
From the Frost must I withdraw them,

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
Bring my box into the chamber,

84
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,400
On the bench-end lay the casket,

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
Underneath this noble gable,

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,280
Underneath this roof of beauty.

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Shall I ope my box of legends,

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
And my chest where lays are treasured?

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
Is the ball to be unravelled,

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,040
And the bundle's knot unfastened?

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,480
Then I'll sing so grand a ballad,

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,920
That it wondrously shall echo,

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,360
While the ryebread I am eating,

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
And the beer of barley drinking.

95
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
But though ale should not be brought me,

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
And though beer should not be offered,

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
I will sing, though dry my throttle,

98
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,560
Or will sing, with water only,

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
To enhance our evening's pleasure,

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,400
Celebrate the daylight's beauty,

101
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,800
Or the beauty of the daybreak,

102
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,200
When another day is dawning.

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,600
I have often heard related,

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,000
And have heard the song recited,

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,400
How the nights closed ever lonely,

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
And the days were shining lonely.

107
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Only born was Väinämöinen,

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,600
And revealed the bard immortal,

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Sprung from the divine Creatrix,

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Born of Ilmatar, his mother.

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Air's young daughter was a virgin,

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Fairest daughter of Creation.

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Long did she abide a virgin,

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,000
All the long days of her girlhood,

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,400
In the Air's own spacious mansions,

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,800
In those far extending regions.

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Wearily the time passed ever.

118
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,600
And her life became a burden,

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Dwelling evermore so lonely,

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,400
Always living as a maiden,

121
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,800
In the Air's own spacious mansions,

122
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,200
In those far-extending deserts.

123
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,600
After this the maid descending,

124
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Sank upon the tossing billows,

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,320
On the open ocean's surface,

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,640
On the wide expanse of water.

127
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,960
Then a storm arose in fury,

128
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,280
From the East a mighty tempest,

129
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,600
And the sea was wildly foaming,

130
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,920
And the waves dashed ever higher.

131
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,240
Thus the tempest rocked the virgin,

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,560
And the billows drove the maiden,

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,880
O'er the ocean's azure surface,

134
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,200
On the crest of foaming billows,

135
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,520
Till the wind that blew around her,

136
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,840
And the sea woke life within her.

137
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,160
Then she bore her heavy burden,

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,480
And the pain it brought upon her,

139
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Seven long centuries together,

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,120
Nine times longer than a lifetime.

141
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,440
Yet no child was fashioned from her,

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,760
And no offspring was perfected.

143
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,080
Thus she swam, the Water-Mother,

144
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,400
East she swam, and westward swam she,

145
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,720
Swam to north-west and to south-west,

146
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,040
And around in all directions,

147
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,360
In the sharpness of her torment,

148
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,680
In her body's fearful anguish;

149
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,000
Yet no child was fashioned from her,

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,280
And no offspring was perfected.

151
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,560
Then she fell to weeping gently,

152
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,840
And in words like these expressed her:

153
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,120
"O how wretched is my fortune,

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,400
Wandering thus, a child unhappy!

155
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,680
I have wandered far already,

156
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,960
And I dwell beneath the heaven,

157
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,240
By the tempest tossed for ever,

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,520
While the billows drive me onward.

159
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,800
O'er this wide expanse of water,

160
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
On the far-extending billows.

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
"Better were it had I tarried,

162
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,640
Virgin in aerial regions,

163
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
Then I should not drift for ever,

164
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,200
As the Mother of the Waters.

165
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
Here my life is cold and dreary,

166
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,760
Every moment now is painful,

167
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
Ever tossing on the billows,

168
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,320
Ever floating on the water.

169
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,

170
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Ruler of the whole of heaven,

171
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,160
Hasten here, for thou art needed;

172
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
Hasten here at my entreaty.

173
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,720
Free the damsel from her burden,

174
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,000
And release her from her tortures.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,280
Quickly haste, and yet more quickly,

176
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,560
Where I long for thee so sorely."

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,840
Short the time that passed thereafter,

178
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Scarce a moment had passed over,

179
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,400
Ere a beauteous teal came flying

180
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,680
Lightly hovering o'er the water,

181
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,960
Seeking for a spot to rest in,

182
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,240
Searching for a home to dwell in.

183
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,520
Eastward flew she, westward flew she.

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,800
Flew to north-west and to southward,

185
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,080
But the place she sought she found not,

186
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,360
Not a spot, however barren,

187
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,640
Where her nest she could establish,

188
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
Or a resting-place could light on.

189
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,200
Then she hovered, slowly moving,

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,480
And she pondered and reflected,

191
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,760
"If my nest in wind I 'stablish

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
Or should rest it on the billows,

193
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Then the winds will overturn it,

194
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
Or the waves will drift it from me."

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Then the Mother of the Waters,

196
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
Water-Mother, maid aerial,

197
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
From the waves her knee uplifted,

198
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
Raised her shoulder from the billows,

199
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
That the teal her nest might 'stablish,

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,240
And might find a peaceful dwelling.

201
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,480
Then the teal, the bird so beauteous,

202
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
Hovered slow, and gazed around her,

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,960
And she saw the knee uplifted

204
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,200
From the blue waves of the ocean,

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,440
And she thought she saw a hillock,

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,680
Freshly green with springing verdure.

207
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,920
There she flew, and hovered slowly,

208
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,160
Gently on the knee alighting,

209
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,400
And her nest she there established,

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,640
And she laid her eggs all golden,

211
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Six gold eggs she laid within it,

212
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,120
And a seventh she laid of iron.

213
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,360
O'er her eggs the teal sat brooding,

214
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,600
And the knee grew warm beneath her;

215
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,840
And she sat one day, a second,

216
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,080
Brooded also on the third day;

217
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,320
Then the Mother of the Waters,

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Water-Mother, maid aerial,

219
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Felt it hot, and felt it hotter,

220
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,040
And she felt her skin was heated,

221
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,280
Till she thought her knee was burning,

222
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,520
And that all her veins were melting.

223
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,760
Then she jerked her knee with quickness,

224
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,000
And her limbs convulsive shaking,

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
Rolled the eggs into the water,

226
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,480
Down amid the waves of ocean,

227
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,720
And to splinters they were broken,

228
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,960
And to fragments they were shattered.

229
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,200
In the ooze they were not wasted,

230
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,440
Nor the fragments in the water,

231
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,680
But a wondrous change came o'er them,

232
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,920
And the fragments all grew lovely.

233
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,160
From the cracked egg's lower fragment,

234
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,400
Now the solid earth was fashioned,

235
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,640
From the cracked egg's upper fragment,

236
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,880
Rose the lofty arch of heaven,

237
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,120
From the yolk, the upper portion,

238
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,360
Now became the sun's bright lustre;

239
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,600
From the white, the upper portion,

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,840
Rose the moon that shines so brightly;

241
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,080
Whatso in the egg was mottled,

242
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,320
Now became the stars in heaven,

243
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,560
Whatso in the egg was blackish,

244
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,800
In the air as cloudlets floated.

245
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,040
Now the time passed quickly over,

246
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,280
And the years rolled quickly onward,

247
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,520
In the new sun's shining lustre,

248
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,760
In the new moon's softer beaming.

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,000
Still the Water-Mother floated,

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,240
Water-Mother, maid aerial,

251
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,480
Ever on the peaceful waters,

252
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,720
On the billows' foamy surface,

253
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,960
With the moving waves before her,

254
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,200
And the heaven serene behind her.

255
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,440
When the ninth year had passed over,

256
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,680
And the summer tenth was passing,

257
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,920
From the sea her head she lifted,

258
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,160
And her forehead she uplifted,

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,400
And she then began Creation,

260
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,640
And she brought the world to order,

261
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,880
On the open ocean's surface,

262
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,120
On the far extending waters.

263
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,360
Wheresoe'er her hand she pointed,

264
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,600
There she formed the jutting headlands;

265
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,840
Wheresoe'er her feet she rested,

266
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,080
There she formed the caves for fishes;

267
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,320
When she dived beneath the water,

268
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,560
There she formed the depths of ocean;

269
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,800
When towards the land she turned her,

270
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,040
There the level shores extended,

271
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,280
Where her feet to land extended,

272
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,520
Spots were formed for salmon-netting;

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,760
Where her head the land touched lightly,

274
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,000
There the curving bays extended.

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Further from the land she floated,

276
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,400
And abode in open water,

277
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,600
And created rocks in ocean,

278
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,800
And the reefs that eyes behold not,

279
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Where the ships are often shattered,

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,200
And the sailors' lives are ended.

281
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,400
Now the isles were formed already,

282
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,600
In the sea the rocks were planted;

283
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,800
Pillars of the sky established,

284
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
Lands and continents created;

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,200
Rocks engraved as though with figures,

286
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,400
And the hills were cleft with fissures.

287
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,600
Still unborn was Väinämöinen;

288
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,800
Still unborn, the bard immortal.

289
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,200
Rested in his mother's body

291
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,400
For the space of thirty summers,

292
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
And the sum of thirty winters,

293
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,800
Ever on the placid waters,

294
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,000
And upon the foaming billows.

295
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
So he pondered and reflected

296
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,400
How he could continue living

297
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,600
In a resting-place so gloomy,

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,800
In a dwelling far too narrow,

299
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,000
Where he could not see the moonlight,

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Neither could behold the sunlight.

301
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Then he spake the words which follow,

302
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,600
And expressed his thoughts in this wise:

303
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,800
"Aid me Moon, and Sun release me,

304
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,000
And the Great Bear lend his counsel,

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Through the portal that I know not,

306
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Through the unaccustomed passage.

307
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,600
From the little nest that holds me,

308
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
From a dwelling-place so narrow,

309
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,000
To the land conduct the roamer,

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,200
To the open air conduct me,

311
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,400
To behold the moon in heaven,

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,600
And the splendour of the sunlight;

313
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,800
See the Great Bear's stars above me,

314
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,000
And the shining stars in heaven."

315
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,200
When the moon no freedom gave him,

316
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Neither did the sun release him,

317
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,600
Then he wearied of existence,

318
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,800
And his life became a burden.

319
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,000
Thereupon he moved the portal,

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,200
With his finger, fourth in number,

321
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,400
Opened quick the bony gateway,

322
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,600
With the toes upon his left foot,

323
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,800
With his nails beyond the threshold,

324
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,000
With his knees beyond the gateway.

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,250
Headlong in the water falling,

326
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,500
With his hands the waves repelling,

327
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,750
Thus the man remained in ocean,

328
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,000
And the hero on the billows.

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,250
In the sea five years he sojourned,

330
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,500
Waited five years, waited six years,

331
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,750
Seven years also, even eight years,

332
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,000
On the surface of the ocean,

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,250
By a nameless promontory,

334
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,500
Near a barren, treeless country.

335
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,750
On the land his knees he planted,

336
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,000
And upon his arms he rested,

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,250
Rose that he might view the moonbeams,

338
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,500
And enjoy the pleasant sunlight,

339
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,750
See the Great Bear's stars above him,

340
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,000
And the shining stars in heaven.

341
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,250
Thus was ancient Väinämöinen,

342
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,500
He, the ever famous minstrel,

343
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,750
Born of the divine Creatrix,

344
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,000
Born of Ilmatar, his mother.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Born of the divine Creatrix,

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Born of Ilmatar, his mother.
