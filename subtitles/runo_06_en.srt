1
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,108
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

2
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:24,917
Now resolved upon a journey

3
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:28,725
To the cold and dreary regions

4
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:32,533
Of the gloomy land of Pohja.

5
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,342
Then he took his straw-hued stallion

6
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:40,150
Like a pea-stalk in his colour,

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,958
And the golden bit adjusted,

8
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,767
Bridle on his head of silver,

9
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:51,575
On his back himself he seated,

10
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:55,383
And he started on his journey,

11
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:59,192
And he trotted gently onward,

12
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,000
At an easy pace he journeyed,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,808
Mounted on the straw-hued courser,

14
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:10,617
Like a pea-stalk in his colour.

15
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:14,425
Thus through Väinölä he journeyed,

16
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:18,233
Over Kalevala's wide heathlands,

17
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:22,042
And the horse made rapid progress,

18
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:25,850
Home behind, and journey shortened,

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,658
Then across the sea he journeyed,

20
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:33,467
O'er the far-extending billows,

21
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:37,275
With the horse's hoofs unwetted,

22
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:41,083
And his feet unsunk in water.

23
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,892
But the youthful Joukahainen,

24
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:48,700
He, the puny son of Lapland,

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,532
Long had cherished his resentment,

26
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:56,364
And had long indeed been envious

27
00:01:56,364 --> 00:02:00,196
Of the aged Väinämöinen,

28
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:04,028
Of the ever-famous minstrel

29
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:07,860
Then he wrought a mighty crossbow.

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,692
And a splendid bow he fashioned,

31
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:15,524
And he formed the bow of iron,

32
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:19,356
Overlaid the back with copper.

33
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:23,188
And with gold inlaid it also,

34
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:27,020
And with silver he adorned it.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,852
Where did he obtain the bowstring?

36
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,684
Whence a cord to match the weapon?

37
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:38,516
Sinews from the elk of Hiisi,

38
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:42,348
And the hempen cord of Lempo.

39
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,180
Thus at length the bow was finished.

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,012
And the stock was quite completed,

41
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:53,844
And the bow was fair to gaze on,

42
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:57,676
And its value matched its beauty.

43
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:01,508
At its back a horse was standing,

44
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:05,340
On the stock a foal was running,

45
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,172
On the curve a sleeping woman,

46
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:13,004
At the catch a hare was couching.

47
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:16,836
Shafts of wood he likewise fashioned.

48
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:20,668
Every arrow triply feathered,

49
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:24,500
And the shafts were formed of oakwood,

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,312
And he made the heads of pinewood;

51
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:32,124
Thus the arrows were completed,

52
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:35,936
And he fixed the feathers on them,

53
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:39,748
From the swallows' plumage taken.

54
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:43,560
Likewise from the tails of sparrows.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,372
After this, the points he sharpened.

56
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:51,184
And the arrow-points he poisoned.

57
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:54,996
In the black blood of the serpent,

58
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:58,808
In the blood of hissing adders.

59
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:02,620
Thus he made his arrows ready,

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,432
And his bow was fit for bending,

61
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:10,244
And he watched for Väinämöinen,

62
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:14,056
Waited for Suvantolainen,

63
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:17,868
Watched at morning, watched at evenings

64
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:21,680
Waited also through the noontide.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,492
Long he watched for Väinämöinen,

66
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:29,304
Waited long, and wearied never,

67
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:33,116
Sitting gazing from the window,

68
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:36,928
Or upon the stairs he waited,

69
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:40,740
Sometimes lurking by the pathway,

70
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,552
Sometimes watching in the meadow,

71
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:48,364
On his back his well-filled quiver,

72
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:52,176
'Neath his arm his crossbow ready.

73
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:55,988
Then he waited further onwards.

74
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:59,800
Lurking near another building,

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,540
On the cape that juts out sharply,

76
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,280
Where the tongue of land curves outward.

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,020
Near a waterfall, all foaming.

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,760
Past the banks of sacred rivers.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,500
And at length one day it happened.

80
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,240
Very early in the morning,

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,980
As he turned his eyes to westward,

82
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,720
And he turned his head to eastward

83
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,460
Something dark he spied on ocean.

84
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,200
Something blue upon the billows.

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,940
"Is a cloud in east arising,

86
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,680
Or the dawn of day appearing?"

87
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,420
In the east no cloud was rising,

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,160
Nor the dawn of day appearing.

89
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,900
'Twas the aged Väinämöinen,

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,640
'Twas the ever-famous minstrel,

91
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,380
Who to Pohjola was hasting,

92
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,120
As to Pimentola he journeyed,

93
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,860
Mounted on his straw-hued courser.

94
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,600
Like a pea-stalk in his colour.

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,340
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

96
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,080
He, the meagre son of Lapland,

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,820
Spanned in haste his mighty crossbow.

98
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,560
And he aimed the splendid weapon

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,300
At the head of Väinämöinen,

100
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,052
Thus to kill Suvantolainen.

101
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:40,804
Then his mother came and asked him,

102
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:44,556
And the aged one inquired,

103
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:48,308
"Wherefore do you span your weapon,

104
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,060
Bending thus the iron crossbow?"

105
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,812
Then the youthful Joukahainen

106
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:59,564
Answered in the words which follow.

107
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:03,316
"Therefore do I span the weapon.

108
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:07,068
Bending thus the iron crossbow.

109
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:10,820
For the head of Väinämöinen,

110
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,572
Thus to kill Suvantolainen,

111
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:18,324
I will shoot old Väinämöinen,

112
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:22,076
Strike the ever-famous minstrel,

113
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:25,828
Through the heart, and through the liver,

114
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:29,580
'Twixt the shoulders I will shoot him."

115
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,332
But his mother straight forbade him,

116
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:37,084
And dissuaded him from shooting.

117
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:40,836
"Do not shoot at Väinämöinen,

118
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:44,588
Do not Kalevalainen slaughter.

119
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:48,340
Of a noble race is Väinö;

120
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,092
He's my sister's son, my nephew.

121
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:55,844
"If you shoot at Väinämöinen,

122
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:59,596
And should Kalevalainen slaughter.

123
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:03,348
Gladness from the world will vanish,

124
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:07,100
And from earth will song be banished.

125
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,868
In the world is gladness better.

126
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:14,636
And on earth is song more cheerful,

127
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:18,404
Than to Manala if banished.

128
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:22,172
And to Tuonela's darkest regions."

129
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:25,940
Then the youthful Joukahainen

130
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,708
Paused a moment and reflected,

131
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,476
And he pondered for an instant,

132
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:37,244
Though his hands to shoot were ready,

133
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:41,012
One would shoot, and one restrained him,

134
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:44,780
But his sinewy fingers forced him.

135
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,548
And at length these words he uttered,

136
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:52,316
And expressed his own decision:

137
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:56,084
"What if twice from earth in future

138
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:59,852
Every gladness should be banished?

139
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:03,620
Let all songs for ever vanish;

140
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,388
I will shoot my arrows, heedless!"

141
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:11,156
Then he spanned the mighty crossbow.

142
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:14,924
And he drew the bow of copper,

143
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:18,692
And against his left knee bent it,

144
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,460
Steady with his foot he held it,

145
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,228
Took an arrow from his quiver,

146
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:29,996
Chose a triple-feathered arrow,

147
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:33,764
Took the strongest of his arrows,

148
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:37,532
Chose the very best among them,

149
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:41,300
Then upon the groove he laid it,

150
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,040
On the hempen cord he fixed it,

151
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,780
Then his mighty bow he lifted,

152
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,520
And he placed it to his shoulder,

153
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,260
Ready now to shoot the arrow,

154
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,000
And to shoot at Väinämöinen.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,740
And he spoke the words which follow:

156
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,480
"Do thou strike, O birchwood arrow,

157
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,220
Strike thou in the back, O pinewood.

158
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,960
Twang thy best, O hempen bowstring!

159
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,700
If my hand is leaning downward,

160
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,440
Let the arrow then strike higher,

161
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,180
If my hand is bending upward,

162
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,920
Let the arrow then strike downward!"

163
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,660
Quickly then he drew the trigger,

164
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,400
Shot the first among his arrows.

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,140
Far too high the shaft flew upward.

166
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,880
High above his head to skyward,

167
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,620
And it whizzed among the cloudlets,

168
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,360
Through the scattered clouds it wandered.

169
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,100
Thus he shot, in reckless fashion,

170
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,840
Shot the second of his arrows.

171
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,580
Far too low the shot flew downwards.

172
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,320
Deep in Mother Earth 'twas sunken.

173
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,060
Earth was almost sunk to Mana,

174
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,800
And the hills of sand were cloven.

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,548
Then he shot again, a third time,

176
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:22,296
And the third shaft, straighter flying,

177
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:26,044
In the blue elk's spleen was buried,

178
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:29,792
Under aged Väinämöinen,

179
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,540
Thus he shot the straw-hued courser,

180
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,288
Like a pea-stalk in his colour;

181
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:41,036
Through the flesh beneath his shoulder,

182
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:44,784
In the left side deep he pierced him.

183
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:48,532
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

184
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:52,280
Plunged his fingers in the water,

185
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,028
With his hands the waves he parted,

186
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:59,776
Grasping at the foaming billows,

187
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:03,524
From the blue elk's back he tumbled

188
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:07,272
From the steed of pea-stalk colour.

189
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:11,020
Then a mighty wind arising

190
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,768
Raised upon the sea a billow,

191
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,516
And it bore old Väinämöinen,

192
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:22,264
Swimming from the mainland further,

193
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:26,012
O'er the wide expanse of water,

194
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,760
Out into the open ocean.

195
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,508
Then the youthful Joukahainen

196
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:37,256
Uttered words of boastful triumph:

197
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,004
"Now thou ancient Väinämöinen,

198
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:44,752
Never while thy life endureth,

199
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:48,500
In the course of all thy lifetime,

200
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,236
While the golden moon is shining,

201
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:55,972
Walk in Väinölä's fair meadows.

202
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:59,708
Or on Kalevala's broad heathlands!

203
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,444
"May you toss for six years running,

204
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:07,180
Seven long summers ever drifting,

205
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,916
Tossed about for over eight years,

206
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,652
On the wide expanse of water,

207
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:18,388
On the surface of the billows,

208
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:22,124
Drift for six years like a pine-tree,

209
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:25,860
And for seven years like a fir-tree,

210
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,596
And for eight years like a tree-stump!"

211
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:33,332
Then the house again he entered,

212
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:37,068
And at once his mother asked him,

213
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:40,804
"Have you shot at Väinämöinen?

214
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:44,540
Slaughtered Kaleva's famous offspring?"

215
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,276
Then the youthful Joukahainen

216
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:52,012
Answered in the words which follow

217
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:55,748
"I have shot at Väinämöinen,

218
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:59,484
And have o'erthrown Kalevalainen,

219
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:03,220
Sent him swimming in the water,

220
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,956
Swept him out upon the billows,

221
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:10,692
On the restless waves of ocean

222
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:14,428
Where the waves are wildly tossing,

223
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:18,164
And the old man plunged his fingers

224
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:21,900
And his palms amid the waters,

225
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,640
Then upon his side he tumbled,

226
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,380
And upon his back he turned him,

227
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,120
Drifting o'er the waves of ocean,

228
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,860
Out upon the foaming billows."

229
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,600
But his mother made him answer,

230
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,340
"Very evil hast thou acted,

231
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,080
Thus to shoot at Väinämöinen

232
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,820
And to o'erthrow Kalevalainen.

233
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,560
Of Suvantola the hero,

234
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,300
Kalevala's most famous hero."

235
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,600
Of Suvantola the hero,

236
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Kalevala's most famous hero."
