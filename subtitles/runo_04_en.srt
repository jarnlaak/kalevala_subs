1
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,908
Then the little maiden Aino,

2
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,917
Youthful Joukahainen's sister,

3
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,925
Went for besoms to the greenwood,

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,933
Sought for bath-whisks in the bushes;

5
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,942
One she gathered for her father,

6
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:02,950
And a second for her mother,

7
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,958
And she gathered yet another,

8
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,967
For her young and ruddy brother.

9
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:14,975
As she turned her footsteps homeward,

10
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,983
Pushing through the alder-bushes,

11
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:22,992
Came the aged Väinämöinen,

12
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:27,000
And he saw her in the thicket,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,008
Finely clad among the herbage,

14
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,017
And he spoke the words which follow.

15
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:39,025
"Maiden, do not wear for others,

16
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:43,033
But for me alone, O maiden,

17
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:47,042
Round thy neck a beaded necklace,

18
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:51,050
And a cross upon thy bosom.

19
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,058
Plait for me thy beauteous tresses,

20
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:59,067
Bind thy hair with silken ribands."

21
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:03,075
But the young maid gave him answer,

22
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:07,083
"Not for thee, and not for others,

23
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,092
Rests the cross upon my bosom,

24
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:15,100
And my hair is bound with ribands.

25
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,032
Nought I care for sea-borne raiment;

26
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:22,964
Wheaten bread I do not value.

27
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:26,896
I will walk in home-spun garments,

28
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,828
And with crusts will still my hunger,

29
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:34,760
In my dearest father's dwelling,

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,692
And beside my much-loved mother."

31
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,624
From her breast she took the crosslet,

32
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:46,556
Drew the rings from off her fingers,

33
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:50,488
From her neck the beaded necklace,

34
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:54,420
From her head the scarlet ribands.

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,352
Down upon the ground she threw them,

36
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:02,284
Scattered them among the bushes;

37
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:06,216
Then she hastened, ever weeping,

38
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:10,148
Loud lamenting, to the homestead.

39
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,080
At the window sat her father,

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,012
While he carved a hatchet-handle.

41
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:21,944
"Wherefore weepest thou, my daughter,

42
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:25,876
Young, and yet so full of sadness?"

43
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,808
"Cause enough have I for weeping,

44
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:33,740
Cause for weeping and lamenting.

45
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,672
Therefore weep I, dearest father,

46
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:41,604
Weep, and feel so full of sorrow.

47
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:45,536
From my breast I lost the crosslet,

48
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,468
From my belt I dropped the buckle,

49
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:53,400
From my breast my silver crosslet,

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,232
From my waist the copper girdle."

51
00:03:57,232 --> 00:04:01,064
At the gate, her brother sitting,

52
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:04,896
For the sledge was shaping runners.

53
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:08,728
"Wherefore weepest thou, my sister,

54
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:12,560
Young, and yet so full of sorrow?"

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,392
"Cause enough have I for weeping,

56
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:20,224
Cause for weeping and lamenting.

57
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:24,056
Therefore do I weep, poor brother,

58
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,888
Weep, and feel so full of sorrow.

59
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:31,720
Rings I lost from off my fingers,

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,552
From my neck my beaded necklace,

61
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:39,384
And my finger-rings were golden,

62
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:43,216
And my necklace-beads were silver."

63
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,048
At the window sat her sister,

64
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:50,880
As she wove a golden girdle

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,712
"Wherefore weepest thou, poor sister,

66
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:58,544
Young, and yet so full of sorrow?"

67
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:02,376
"Cause enough have I for weeping,

68
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:06,208
Cause for weeping and lamenting.

69
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:10,040
Therefore do I weep, poor sister,

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,872
Weep and feel so full of sorrow.

71
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:17,704
From my brow the gold has fallen,

72
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:21,536
From my hair I lost the silver,

73
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:25,368
Tore the blue bands from my temples,

74
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:29,200
From my head the scarlet braiding."

75
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,952
On the threshold of the storehouse,

76
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:36,704
Skimming milk, she found her mother.

77
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:40,456
"Wherefore weepest thou, my daughter,

78
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:44,208
Young, and yet so full of sorrow?"

79
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,960
"O my mother, who hast borne me,

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,712
O my mother, who hast nursed me,

81
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:55,464
Cause enough have I for anguish,

82
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:59,216
Cause enough for bitter sorrow.

83
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:02,968
Therefore do I weep, poor mother,

84
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:06,720
Therefore grieve I, O my mother,

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,472
To the wood I went for besoms,

86
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:14,224
Gathered bath-whisks from the bushes;

87
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:17,976
One I gathered for my father,

88
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:21,728
One I gathered for my mother,

89
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:25,480
And I gathered yet another,

90
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,232
For my young and ruddy brother.

91
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:32,984
As I turned my footsteps homeward,

92
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:36,736
And across the heath was tripping,

93
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:40,488
From the dell there called Osmoinen,

94
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:44,240
From the field cried Kalevainen,

95
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,992
"Do not wear, fair maid, for others,

96
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,744
But for me alone, poor maiden,

97
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,496
Round thy neck a beaded necklace,

98
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:59,248
And a cross upon thy bosom.

99
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:03,000
Plait for me thy beauteous tresses,

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,692
Braid thy hair with silken ribands."

101
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,384
"From my breast I took the crosslet,

102
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:14,076
From my neck the beaded necklace,

103
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:17,768
Tore the blue bands from my temples,

104
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:21,460
From my head the scarlet ribands,

105
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,152
Then upon the ground I threw them,

106
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:28,844
Scattered them among the bushes,

107
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:32,536
And I answered him in this wise:

108
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,228
'Not for thee, and not for others,

109
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:39,920
Rests my cross upon my bosom,

110
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,612
And my hair is bound with ribands.

111
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:47,304
Nought I care for sea-borne raiment,

112
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:50,996
Wheaten bread I do not value.

113
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:54,688
I will walk in home-spun garments,

114
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:58,380
And with crusts will still my hunger,

115
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,072
In my dearest father's dwelling,

116
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:05,764
And beside my much-loved mother.'"

117
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:09,456
And her mother answered thus wise,

118
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:13,148
Said the old crone to the maiden,

119
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:16,840
"Do not weep, my dearest daughter,

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,532
Do not grieve (and thou so youthful);

121
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:24,224
Eat a whole year long fresh butter,

122
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:27,916
That your form may grow more rounded,

123
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,608
Eat thou pork the second season,

124
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:35,300
That your form may grow more charming,

125
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,932
And the third year eat thou cream-cakes,

126
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:42,564
That you may become more lovely.

127
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,196
Seek the storehouse on the mountain,

128
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:49,828
There the finest chamber open.

129
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,460
There are coffers piled on coffers,

130
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,092
Chests in heaps on chests are loaded,

131
00:08:57,092 --> 00:09:00,724
Open then the finest coffer,

132
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:04,356
Raise the painted lid with clangour,

133
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:07,988
There you'll find six golden girdles,

134
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:11,620
Seven blue robes of finest texture,

135
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,252
Woven by the Moon's own daughter,

136
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,884
By the Sun's own daughter fashioned.

137
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:22,516
"In the days when I was youthful,

138
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:26,148
In my youthful days of girlhood,

139
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,780
In the wood I sought for berries,

140
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,412
Gathered raspberries on the mountain,

141
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:37,044
Heard the moonlight's daughter weaving,

142
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:40,676
And the sunlight's daughter spinning,

143
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:44,308
There beside the wooded island,

144
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:47,940
On the borders of the greenwood.

145
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,572
"Thereupon I softly neared them,

146
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:55,204
And beside them took my station,

147
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:58,836
And began to ask them gently,

148
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:02,468
In the words that I repeat you:

149
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,100
'Give you of your gold, O Kuutar,

150
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,680
And your silver give, Paivatar,

151
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,260
To the maiden poorly dowered,

152
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,840
To the child who now implores you!'

153
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,420
"Then her gold did Kuutar give me.

154
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,000
And her silver gave Paivatar.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,580
With the gold I decked my temples,

156
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,160
And adorned my head with silver,

157
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,740
Homeward like a flower I hastened,

158
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,320
Joyful, to my father's dwelling.

159
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,900
"These I wore one day, a second.

160
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,480
Then upon the third day after

161
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,060
Took the gold from off my temples.

162
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,640
From my head removed the silver,

163
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,220
Took them to the mountain storehouse;

164
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,800
In the chest with care I laid them,

165
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,380
There until this day I left them,

166
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,960
And since then I have not seen them.

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,540
"On thy brows bind silken ribands

168
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,120
On thy temples gold adornments,

169
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,700
Round thy neck a beaded necklace,

170
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,280
On thy breast a golden crosslet.

171
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,860
Put thou on a shift of linen,

172
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,440
Of the finest flax that's woven,

173
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,020
Lay thou on a robe of woollen,

174
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,600
Bind it with a silken girdle,

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,136
Then the finest silken stockings,

176
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:42,672
And of shoes the very finest,

177
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:46,208
Then In plaits thy hair arranging,

178
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,744
Bind it up with silken ribands,

179
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:53,280
Slip the gold rings on thy fingers,

180
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,816
Deck thy wrists with golden bracelets.

181
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,352
After this return thou homewards

182
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,888
From thy visit to the storehouse,

183
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:07,424
As the joy of all thy kindred,

184
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:10,960
And of all thy race the fairest,

185
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,496
Like a floweret by the wayside,

186
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:18,032
Like a raspberry on the mountain;

187
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:21,568
Far more lovely than aforetime,

188
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:25,104
Fairer than in former seasons."

189
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:28,640
Thus the mother urged her counsel,

190
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,176
Thus she spoke unto her daughter,

191
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:35,712
But the daughter did not heed her,

192
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:39,248
Heeded not her mother's counsel.

193
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:42,784
From the house she wandered weeping,

194
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:46,320
From the homestead went in sorrow,

195
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,856
And she said the words which follow,

196
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:53,392
And expressed herself in this wise:

197
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:56,928
'What may be the joyous feelings,

198
00:12:56,928 --> 00:13:00,464
And the thoughts of one rejoicing?

199
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:04,000
Such may be the joyous feelings,

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,488
And the thoughts of one rejoicing;

201
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:10,976
Like the dancing of the water

202
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:14,464
On the waves when gently swelling.

203
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:17,952
What do mournful thoughts resemble?

204
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:21,440
What the long-tailed duck may ponder?

205
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,928
Such may mournful thoughts resemble,

206
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:28,416
Thus the long-tailed duck may ponder,

207
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,904
As 'neath frozen snow embedded,

208
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:35,392
Water deep in well imprisoned.

209
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:38,880
"Often now my life is clouded.

210
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,368
Often is my childhood troubled,

211
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,856
And my thoughts like withered herbage.

212
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,344
As I wander through the bushes,

213
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:52,832
Wandering on through grassy meadows,

214
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,320
Pushing through the tangled thickets,

215
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,808
And my thoughts are pitch for blackness

216
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:03,296
And my heart than soot not brighter.

217
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:06,784
"Better fortune had befel me,

218
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:10,272
And it would have been more happy.

219
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:13,760
Had I not been born and nurtured,

220
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,248
And had never grown in stature,

221
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:20,736
Till I saw these days of sorrow,

222
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:24,224
And this joyless time o'ertook me,

223
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:27,712
Had I died in six nights only,

224
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:31,200
Or upon the eighth had perished.

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,652
Much I should not then have needed,

226
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:38,104
But a shroud a span-long only,

227
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:41,556
And of earth a tiny corner.

228
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:45,008
Little then had wept my mother,

229
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:48,460
Fewer tears had shed my father,

230
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,912
And my brother not a tearlet."

231
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:55,364
Thus she wept a day, a second.

232
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:58,816
And again her mother asked her,

233
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:02,268
"Wherefore dost thou weep, poor maiden.

234
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,720
Wherefore thus lament and sorrow?"

235
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,172
"Therefore weep I, hapless maiden,

236
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:12,624
Therefore do I weep for ever,

237
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:16,076
That yourself have pledged me, hapless.

238
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:19,528
And your daughter you have promised

239
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,980
Thus to be an old man's comfort,

240
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,432
As a solace to the old man,

241
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:29,884
To support his feeble footsteps,

242
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:33,336
And to wait upon him always.

243
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:36,788
Better were it had you sent me

244
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:40,240
Deeply down beneath the billows,

245
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,692
There to be the powan's sister,

246
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,144
And companion of the fishes.

247
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:50,596
In the lake 'tis surely better

248
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:54,048
There beneath the waves to sojourn,

249
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:57,500
There to be the powan's sister.

250
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,924
And companion of the fishes,

251
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:04,348
Than to be an old man's comfort.

252
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:07,772
To support his aged footsteps,

253
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:11,196
So that I can mend his stockings,

254
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:14,620
And may be a staff to prop him."

255
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,044
Then she sought the mountain storehouse,

256
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,468
And the inner room she entered;

257
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:24,892
And the finest chest she opened,

258
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:28,316
Raised the painted lid with clangour,

259
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:31,740
And she found six golden girdles,

260
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,164
Seven blue robes of finest textures,

261
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:38,588
And she robed her in the finest,

262
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:42,012
And completed her adornment.

263
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:45,436
Set the gold upon her temples,

264
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:48,860
On her hair the shining silver,

265
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,284
On her brow the sky-blue ribands,

266
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:55,708
On her head the bands of scarlet.

267
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,132
Then she wandered from the storehouses,

268
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:02,556
And across the fields she wandered,

269
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,980
Past the marshes, and the heathlands,

270
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,404
Through the shady, gloomy forests.

271
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,828
Thus she sang, as on she hastened,

272
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:16,252
Thus she spoke, as on she wandered:

273
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,676
"All my heart is filled with trouble;

274
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:23,100
On my head a stone is loaded.

275
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,504
But my trouble would not vex me,

276
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,908
And the weight would less oppress me,

277
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:33,312
If I perished, hapless maiden,

278
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:36,716
Ending thus my life of sorrow,

279
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:40,120
In the burden of my trouble,

280
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,524
In the sadness of my sorrow.

281
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:46,928
"Now my time perchance approaches,

282
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:50,332
From this weary world to hasten,

283
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:53,736
Time to seek the world of Mana,

284
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:57,140
Time to Tuonela to hasten,

285
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,544
For my father will not mourn me,

286
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:03,948
Nor my mother will lament me,

287
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:07,352
Nor my sister's cheeks be moistened,

288
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,756
Nor my brother's eyes be tearful,

289
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,160
If I sank beneath the waters,

290
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,564
Sinking where the fish are sporting,

291
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,968
To the depths beneath the billows,

292
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:24,372
Down amid the oozy blackness."

293
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:27,776
On she went, one day, a second,

294
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:31,180
And at length, upon the third day,

295
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,584
Came she to a lake's broad margin,

296
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,988
To the bank, o'ergrown with rushes.

297
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:41,392
And she reached it in the night-time,

298
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:44,796
And she halted in the darkness.

299
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:48,200
In the evening wept the maiden,

300
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,572
Through the darksome night lamented,

301
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:54,944
On the rocks that fringed the margin,

302
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:58,316
Where a bay spread wide before her.

303
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:01,688
At the earliest dawn of morning,

304
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:05,060
As she gazed from off a headland,

305
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,432
Just beyond she saw three maidens,

306
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,804
Bathing there amid the waters,

307
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:15,176
Aino made the fourth among then,

308
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:18,548
And the fifth a slender sapling.

309
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,920
Then her shift she cast on willows,

310
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,292
And her dress upon the aspens,

311
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:28,664
On the open ground her stockings,

312
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:32,036
Threw her shoes upon the boulders,

313
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:35,408
On the sand her beads she scattered,

314
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,780
And her rings upon the shingle.

315
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,152
In the waves a rock was standing,

316
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:45,524
Brightly hued and golden shining;

317
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:48,896
And she swam and sought to reach it,

318
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:52,268
As a refuge in her trouble.

319
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:55,640
When at length she stood upon it,

320
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,012
And would rest upon the summit,

321
00:19:59,012 --> 00:20:02,384
On the stone of many colours,

322
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:05,756
On the rock so smooth and shining,

323
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:09,128
In the waves it sank beneath her,

324
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:12,500
Sinking to the very bottom.

325
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,958
With the rock, the maiden Aino

326
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,417
Sank beneath the water's surface.

327
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,875
There the dove for ever vanished,

328
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,333
Thus the luckless maiden perished,

329
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,792
She herself exclaimed in dying,

330
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:33,250
When she felt that she was sinking:

331
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,708
"To the lake I went to bathe me,

332
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:40,167
And to swim upon its surface,

333
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:43,625
But, like tender dove, I vanished,

334
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,083
Like a bird by death o'ertaken.

335
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,542
Never may my dearest father,

336
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:54,000
Never while his life endureth,

337
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,515
Cast his net amid the waters,

338
00:20:57,515 --> 00:21:01,031
In these waves, so wide extending.

339
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:04,546
"To the shore I went to wash me,

340
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:08,062
To the lake I went to bathe me,

341
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:11,577
But, like tender dove, I vanished,

342
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:15,092
Like a bird by death overtaken.

343
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:18,608
Never may my dearest mother,

344
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:22,123
Never while her life endureth,

345
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:25,638
Fetch the water for her baking,

346
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:29,154
From the wide bay near her dwelling.

347
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,669
"To the shore I went to wash me,

348
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:36,185
To the lake I went to bathe me,

349
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:39,700
But, like tender dove, I vanished,

350
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,186
Like a bird by death o'ertaken.

351
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:46,673
Never may my dearest brother,

352
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,159
Never while his life endureth,

353
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,645
Water here his prancing courser,

354
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,132
Here upon the broad lake's margin

355
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,618
"To the shore I went to wash me,

356
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:04,105
To the lake I went to bathe me,

357
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:07,591
But, like tender dove, I vanished,

358
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:11,077
Like a bird by death overtaken.

359
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:14,564
Never may my dearest sister,

360
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:18,050
Never while her life endureth,

361
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,536
Hither stay to wash her eyebrows,

362
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:25,023
On the bridge so near her dwelling.

363
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:28,509
In the lake the very water

364
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:31,995
Is as blood that leaves my veinlets;

365
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:35,482
Every fish that swims this water,

366
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:38,968
Is as flesh from off my body;

367
00:22:38,968 --> 00:22:42,455
All the bushes on the margin

368
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:45,941
Are as ribs of me unhappy;

369
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:49,427
And the grass upon the margin

370
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:52,914
As my soiled and tangled tresses."

371
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:56,400
Thus the youthful maiden perished,

372
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:07,500
And the dove so lovely vanished.

373
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,050
Who shall now the tidings carry.

374
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,600
And repeat the mournful story,

375
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,056
At the dwelling of the maiden,

376
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:21,512
At the homestead of the fair one?

377
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:24,968
First the bear would take the tidings,

378
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:28,424
And repeat the mournful story;

379
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:31,880
But the bear conveyed no tidings,

380
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,336
For he strayed among the cattle.

381
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:38,792
Who shall now the tidings carry,

382
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,248
And repeat the mournful story.

383
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:45,704
At the dwelling of the maiden.

384
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:49,160
At the homestead of the fair one?

385
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,616
Then the wolf would take the message,

386
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:56,072
And repeat the mournful story;

387
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:59,528
But the wolf conveyed no tidings,

388
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:02,984
For among the sheep he wandered.

389
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,440
Who shall now the tidings carry,

390
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,896
And repeat the mournful story,

391
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:13,352
At the dwelling of the maiden,

392
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,808
At the homestead of the fair one?

393
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:20,264
Then the fox would take the message,

394
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:23,720
And repeat the mournful story;

395
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,176
But the fox conveyed no tidings,

396
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:30,632
For among the geese he wandered.

397
00:24:30,632 --> 00:24:34,088
Who shall now the tidings carry,

398
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:37,544
And repeat the mournful story,

399
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:41,000
At the dwelling of the maiden,

400
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,360
At the homestead of the fair one?

401
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,720
'Twas the hare who took the tidings,

402
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,080
And conveyed the mournful story;

403
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,440
For the hare replied discreetly,

404
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,800
"I will not forget the message."

405
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,160
Then the hare sprang quickly onward,

406
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,520
Sped the Long-ear with his story,

407
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,880
On his crooked legs he hastened,

408
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,240
With his cross-like mouth he hurried,

409
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,600
To the dwelling of the maiden,

410
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,960
To the homestead of the fair one.

411
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,320
Thus he hastened to the bath-house

412
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,680
And he crouched upon the threshold.

413
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,040
Full of maidens is the bath-house,

414
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,400
In their hands the bath-whisks holding.

415
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,760
"Scamp, come here; and shall we boil you,

416
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,120
Or, O Broad-eye, shall we roast you,

417
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,480
Either for the master's supper,

418
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,840
Or perchance the mistress' breakfast,

419
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,200
For the luncheon of the daughter,

420
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,560
Or perchance the son to dine on?"

421
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,920
Thereupon the hare responded,

422
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,280
And the Round-eye answered boldly,

423
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,640
"Would that Lempo might come hither

424
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,000
For the cooking in the kettle!

425
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,332
I am come to give you tidings,

426
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:11,664
And to bring a message to you.

427
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,996
Vanished from you is the fair one,

428
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:18,328
Perished has the tin-adorned one.

429
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,660
Sunken with her silver buckle,

430
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,992
Drowning with her belt of copper,

431
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:28,324
Diving in the muddy water,

432
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:31,656
To the depths below the billows,

433
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,988
There to be the powan's sister,

434
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:38,320
And companion of the fishes."

435
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,652
Then her mother fell to weeping,

436
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:44,984
And her bitter tears flowed freely,

437
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:48,316
And she loud lamented, speaking

438
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,648
In her grief the words which follow:

439
00:26:51,648 --> 00:26:54,980
"Never, O unhappy mothers,

440
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,312
Never while your life endureth,

441
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:01,644
Never may you urge your daughters,

442
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:04,976
Or attempt to force your children

443
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:08,308
To a marriage that repels them,

444
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:11,640
Like myself, O wretched mother,

445
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,972
Urging vainly thus my daughter,

446
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:18,304
Thus my little dove I fostered."

447
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,636
Thus the mother wept, lamenting,

448
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:24,968
And her bitter tears flowed freely

449
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:28,300
From her blue eyes in her sadness,

450
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,632
O'er her cheeks, so pale with sorrow.

451
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:34,964
After one tear flowed another,

452
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:38,296
And her bitter tears flowed freely

453
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:41,628
From her cheeks, so pale with sorrow,

454
00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:44,960
To her breast, so sadly heaving.

455
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,292
After one tear flowed another,

456
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,624
And her bitter tears flowed freely

457
00:27:51,624 --> 00:27:54,956
From her breast, so sadly heaving,

458
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:58,288
On the borders of her garments.

459
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:01,620
After one tear flowed another,

460
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,952
And her bitter tears flowed freely

461
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:08,284
From the borders of her garments

462
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:11,616
Down upon her scarlet stockings.

463
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:14,948
After one tear flowed another,

464
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:18,280
And her bitter tears flowed freely

465
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,612
Down from off her scarlet stockings

466
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:24,944
To her shoes, all gold-embroidered.

467
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:28,276
After one tear flowed another,

468
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:31,608
And her bitter tears flowed freely

469
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:34,940
From her shoes, all gold-embroidered,

470
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,272
On the ground where she was standing.

471
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,604
As they flowed, the ground they moistened.

472
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:44,936
And they swelled to streams of water.

473
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:48,268
On the ground the streams were flowing,

474
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,600
And became the source of rivers;

475
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,944
Thence arose three mighty rivers

476
00:28:54,944 --> 00:28:58,288
From the tears of bitter weeping,

477
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:01,632
Which were ever ceaseless flowing

478
00:29:01,632 --> 00:29:04,976
From the weeping mother's eyelids.

479
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,320
From each stream that thus was fashioned,

480
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,664
Rushed three waterfalls in fury,

481
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:15,008
And amid each cataract's flowing.

482
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:18,352
Three great rocks arose together.

483
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:21,696
And on every rocky summit

484
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:25,040
There arose a golden mountain.

485
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,384
And on every mountain summit

486
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:31,728
Up there sprang three beauteous birch-trees,

487
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,072
In the crown of every birch-tree,

488
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:38,416
Golden cuckoos three were perching.

489
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:41,760
All at once they called together,

490
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,104
And the first cried, "Sweetheart, sweetheart!"

491
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:48,448
And the second, "Lover, lover!"

492
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:51,792
And the third cried, "Gladness, gladness!"

493
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:55,136
He who cried out, "Sweetheart, sweetheart!"

494
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:58,480
Sang his song for three months running,

495
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,824
For the young and loveless maiden,

496
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:05,168
Resting now beneath the water.

497
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:08,512
He who cried out, "Lover, lover!"

498
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:11,856
Sang his song for six months running,

499
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:15,200
Sang to the unhappy suitor,

500
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,574
Who must sorrow through his lifetime.

501
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:21,947
He who cried out, "Gladness, gladness!"

502
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:25,321
Sang his song for all a lifetime;

503
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:28,695
Sang to the unhappy mother,

504
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:32,068
Who must daily weep for ever.

505
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:35,442
And the mother spoke as follows!

506
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:38,816
As she listened to the cuckoo:

507
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:42,189
"Never may a hapless mother

508
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:45,563
Listen to the cuckoo crying!

509
00:30:45,563 --> 00:30:48,937
When I hear the cuckoo calling.

510
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:52,311
Heavy beats my heart within me.

511
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:55,684
From my eyes the tears are falling

512
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:59,058
O'er my cheeks are waters rolling.

513
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:02,432
And the drops like peas are swelling.

514
00:31:02,432 --> 00:31:05,805
Than the largest broad-beans larger.

515
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:09,179
By an ell my life is shortened,

516
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,553
By a span-length I am older,

517
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:15,926
And my strength has wholly failed me,

518
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:19,300
Since I heard the cuckoo calling,"

519
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,100
And my strength has wholly failed me,

520
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Since I heard the cuckoo calling,"
