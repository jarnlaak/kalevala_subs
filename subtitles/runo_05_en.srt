1
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,525
Now the tidings were repeated,

2
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,150
And the news was widely rumoured,

3
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,775
How the youthful maid had perished,

4
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,400
And the fair one had departed.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,025
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

6
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:52,650
Deeply sorrowed at the tidings;

7
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,275
Wept at evening, wept at morning,

8
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:59,900
Spent the livelong night in weeping,

9
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,525
For the fair one who had perished,

10
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:07,150
For the maiden who had slumbered,

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,775
In the muddy lake downsunken

12
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,400
To the depths below the billows.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,025
Then he went, in sorrow sighing,

14
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:21,650
While his heart was filled with anguish,

15
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,275
To the blue lake's rocky margin,

16
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,900
And he spoke the words which follow:

17
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,525
"Tell me, Untamo, thou sleeper,

18
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,150
Tell me all thy dreams, O idler,

19
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,775
Where to find the realm of Ahto,

20
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:43,400
Where dwell Vellamo's fair maidens?"

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,025
Sleeper Untamo made answer,

22
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:50,650
And his dreams he thus repeated:

23
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,275
"There has Ahto fixed his country,

24
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,900
There dwell Vellamo's fair maidens,

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,432
Near the cloud-encompassed headland,

26
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:04,964
Near the ever-misty island,

27
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:08,496
In the depths below the billows,

28
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:12,028
On the black ooze at the bottom.

29
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:15,560
"There has Ahto fixed his country,

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,092
There dwell Vellamo's fair maidens,

31
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:22,624
Living in a narrow chamber,

32
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:26,156
In a little room abiding,

33
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:29,688
With the walls of varied marble,

34
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:33,220
In the depths beside the headland."

35
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,752
Then the aged Väinämöinen

36
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:40,284
Hastened to his little vessel,

37
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:43,816
And he scanned his fishing-tackle,

38
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:47,348
And his hooks with care inspected;

39
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:50,880
Put the tackle in his pocket,

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,412
And the barbed hooks in his wallet.

41
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:57,944
Through the waves his boat he ferried,

42
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,476
Making for the jutting headland,

43
00:03:01,476 --> 00:03:05,008
To the cape, with clouds encompassed,

44
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:08,540
And the ever-misty island.

45
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,072
Then he set about his fishing,

46
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:15,604
And he watched his angle closely,

47
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:19,136
And he held his hand-net ready,

48
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:22,668
Dropped his angle in the water,

49
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:26,200
And he fished, and tried his fortune,

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,652
While the rod of copper trembled,

51
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:33,104
And the thread of silver whistled,

52
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:36,556
And the golden line whirred loudly.

53
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:40,008
And at length one day it happened,

54
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,460
Very early in the morning,

55
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,912
On his hook a fish was hanging,

56
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:50,364
And a salmon-trout was captured.

57
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,816
In the boat he drew it quickly,

58
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,268
And upon the planks he cast it.

59
00:03:57,268 --> 00:04:00,720
Then he scanned the fish, and turned it,

60
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,172
And he spoke the words which follow;

61
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:07,624
"'Tis a fish, among the fishes,

62
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:11,076
For I never saw its equal,

63
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:14,528
Smoother is it than a powan,

64
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:17,980
Than a salmon-trout more yellow,

65
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,432
Greyer than a pike I deem it,

66
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:24,884
For a female fish too finless,

67
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:28,336
For a male 'tis far too scaleless;

68
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:31,788
Has no tresses, like a maiden,

69
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:35,240
Nor, like water-nymphs, 'tis belted;

70
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,692
Nor is earless like a pigeon;

71
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:42,144
It resembles most a salmon,

72
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:45,596
Or a perch from deepest water."

73
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:49,048
In his waistband Väinämöinen

74
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:52,500
Bore a case-knife, silver-hafted,

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,904
And he drew the knife of sharpness.

76
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:59,308
Drew the case-knife, silver-hafted,

77
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:02,712
And prepared to slit the salmon,

78
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:06,116
And to cut the fish to pieces,

79
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:09,520
Thought to eat it for his breakfast.

80
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,924
Or a snack to make his luncheon,

81
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:16,328
To provide him with a dinner,

82
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,732
And a plenteous supper likewise.

83
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:23,136
As he would have slit the salmon.

84
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:26,540
And would cut the fish to pieces,

85
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,944
Sprang the salmon in the water,

86
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:33,348
For the beauteous fish jumped sideways

87
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:36,752
From the planking of the red boat,

88
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:40,156
From the boat of Väinämöinen.

89
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:43,560
Thereupon her head she lifted,

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,964
Raised her shoulders from the water,

91
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:50,368
On the fifth wave's watery hillock,

92
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:53,772
From the sixth high wave emerging,

93
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:57,176
Then her hands in air uplifted,

94
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:00,580
And displayed her left foot also,

95
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,984
When the seventh wave roses upswelling,

96
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:07,388
And upon the ninth wave's summit.

97
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,792
Thereupon the fish addressed him,

98
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:14,196
And it spoke, and thus protested:

99
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:17,600
"O thou aged Väinämöinen,

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,020
Surely I have not come hither,

101
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,440
Like a salmon, to be slaughtered,

102
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,860
Or a fish, to cut to pieces,

103
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,280
Only to become your breakfast,

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,700
Or a snack to make your luncheon,

105
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,120
To provide you with a dinner.

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,540
And a plenteous supper likewise."

107
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,960
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,380
"Wherefore didst thou then come hither?"

109
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,800
"Therefore 'tis that I have sought thee,

110
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,220
In thine arm like dove to nestle,

111
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,640
By thy side to sit for ever,

112
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,060
On thy knee, as consort sitting,

113
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,480
To prepare the couch to rest thee,

114
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,900
And to smooth thy pillow for thee,

115
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,320
Keep thy little room in order,

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,740
And to sweep the flooring for thee,

117
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,160
In thy room to light the fire,

118
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,580
And to fan the flames up brightly,

119
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,000
There large loaves of bread to bake thee,

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,420
Cakes of honey to prepare thee,

121
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,840
And thy jug of beer to fill thee,

122
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,260
And thy dinner set before thee.

123
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,680
"I am not a water-salmon,

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,100
Not a perch from deepest water,

125
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,500
But a young and lovely maiden,

126
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,900
Youthful Joukahainen's sister,

127
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,300
Whom thou all thy life hast longed for,

128
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,700
Whom thou hast so long desired.

129
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,100
"O thou pitiful old creature,

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,500
Väinämöinen, void of wisdom,

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,900
Thou hadst not the wit to hold me,

132
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,300
Vellamo's young water-maiden,

133
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Me, the darling child of Ahto!"

134
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,731
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

135
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:24,163
Head bowed down, and deeply grieving,

136
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:27,594
"Sister thou of Joukahainen,

137
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:31,025
Once again return, I pray thee."

138
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:34,456
But she never more came near him,

139
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:37,888
Ne'er again throughout his lifetime;

140
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:41,319
For she turned away, and, diving,

141
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,750
Vanished from the water's surface

142
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,181
Down among the rocks so varied,

143
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:51,613
In a liver-coloured crevice.

144
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:55,044
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

145
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:58,475
Pondered deeply, and reflected,

146
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:01,906
What to do, and what was needful

147
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:05,338
Quick he wove a net all silken,

148
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:08,769
And he drew it straight and crossways,

149
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:12,200
Through the reach, and then across it,

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,580
Drew it through the quiet waters,

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,960
Through the depths beloved by salmons

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,340
And through Väinölä's deep waters.

153
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,720
And by Kalevala's sharp headlands,

154
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,100
Through the deep, dark watery caverns,

155
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,480
And the wide expanse of water,

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,860
And through Joukola's great rivers,

157
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,240
And across the bays of Lapland.

158
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,620
Other fish he caught in plenty,

159
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,000
All the fishes of the waters,

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,380
Only not the fish he sought for,

161
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,760
Which he kept in mind for ever,

162
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,140
Never Vellamo's fair maiden,

163
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,520
Not the dearest child of Ahto.

164
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,900
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

165
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,280
Bowed his head, lamenting deeply,

166
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,660
With his cap adjusted sideways,

167
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,040
And he spoke the words which follow:

168
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,420
"O how grievous is my folly,

169
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,800
Weak am I in manly wisdom,

170
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,180
Once indeed was understanding,

171
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,560
Insight too conferred upon me,

172
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,940
And my heart was great within me;

173
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,320
Such in former times my portion.

174
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,700
But in days that now are passing.

175
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,092
In the evil days upon me,

176
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:43,484
Now my strength with age is failing,

177
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:46,876
All my understanding weakens

178
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:50,268
And my insight has departed,

179
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:53,660
All my judgment is perverted.

180
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,052
"She for whom long years I waited,

181
00:10:57,052 --> 00:11:00,444
Whom for half my life I longed for,

182
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:03,836
Vellamo's fair water-maiden,

183
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:07,228
Youngest daughter of the surges.

184
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:10,620
Who should be my friend for ever,

185
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,012
And my wife throughout my lifetime,

186
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:17,404
Came and seized the bait I offered,

187
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:20,796
In my boat sprang unresisting,

188
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:24,188
But I knew not how to hold her,

189
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:27,580
To my home I could not take her,

190
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,972
But she plunged amid the waters,

191
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:34,364
Diving to the depths profoundest."

192
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,756
Then he wandered on a little,

193
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:41,148
And he walked, in sadness sighing,

194
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:44,540
To his home direct returning,

195
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,932
And he spoke the words which follow:

196
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:51,324
"Once indeed the birds were singing,

197
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:54,716
And my joyous cuckoo hailed me,

198
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:58,108
Both at morning and at evening,

199
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:01,500
Likewise, too, in midday hours.

200
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,904
What has stilled their lively music,

201
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:08,308
And has hushed their charming voices?

202
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:11,712
Care has stilled their lively music,

203
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:15,116
Sorrow checked their cheerful voices,

204
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:18,520
Therefore do they sing no longer,

205
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,924
Neither at the sun's declining,

206
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:25,328
To rejoice me in the evening,

207
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,732
Nor to cheer me in the morning.

208
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:32,136
"Now no more can I consider

209
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:35,540
How to shape my course of action,

210
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,944
How upon the earth to sojourn,

211
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:42,348
How throughout the world to travel.

212
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:45,752
Would my mother now were living,

213
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:49,156
And my aged mother waking!

214
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:52,560
She would surely tell me truly

215
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,964
How to best support my trouble,

216
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:59,368
That my grief may not o'erwhelm me,

217
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:02,772
And my sorrow may not crush me,

218
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:06,176
In these weary days of evil,

219
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:09,580
In this time of deep depression."

220
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,984
In her grave his mother wakened,

221
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:16,388
Answered from beneath the billows:

222
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:19,792
"Still thy mother lives and hears thee,

223
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:23,196
And thy aged mother wakens,

224
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:26,600
That she plainly may advise thee.

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,006
How to best support thy trouble.

226
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:33,412
That thy grief may not o'erwhelm thee,

227
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,818
And thy sorrow may not crush thee,

228
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:40,224
In these weary days of evil,

229
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:43,629
In these days of deep depression.

230
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:47,035
Seek thou out the maids of Pohja,

231
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,441
Where the daughters are more handsome,

232
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,847
And the maidens twice as lovely,

233
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:57,253
And are five or six times nimbler,

234
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,659
Not like lazy girls of Jouko,

235
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,065
Lapland's fat and sluggish daughters.

236
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:07,471
"Thence a wife, O son, provide thee,

237
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,876
From the fairest maids of Pohja;

238
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:14,282
Choose a maid of fair complexion,

239
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,688
Lovely, too, in every feature,

240
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:21,094
One whose feet are always nimble,

241
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,500
Always active in her movements."

242
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,000
One whose feet are always nimble,

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Always active in her movements."
