1
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,538
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast

2
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:22,175
Passed the days of his existence

3
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,812
Where lie Väinölä's sweet meadows,

4
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:29,450
Kalevala's extended heathlands:

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,087
There he sang his songs of sweetness

6
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:36,725
Sang his songs and proved his wisdom.

7
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:40,362
Day by day he sang unwearied,

8
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:44,000
Night by night discoursed unceasing,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,637
Sang the songs of by-gone ages,

10
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:51,275
Hidden words of ancient wisdom,

11
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,912
Songs which all the children sing not.

12
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:58,550
All beyond men's comprehension,

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,187
In these ages of misfortune,

14
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,825
When the race is near Its ending.

15
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:09,462
Far away the news was carried,

16
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:13,100
Far abroad was spread the tidings

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,737
Of the songs of Väinämöinen,

18
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:20,375
Of the wisdom of the hero;

19
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:24,013
In the south was spread the rumour;

20
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:27,650
Reached to Pohjola the tidings.

21
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,287
Here dwelt youthful Joukahainen,

22
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:34,925
He, the meagre youth of Lapland;

23
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:38,562
And, when visiting the village,

24
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:42,200
Wondrous tales he heard related,

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,732
How there dwelt another minstrel,

26
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:49,264
And that better songs were carolled.

27
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:52,796
Far in Väinölä's sweet meadows,

28
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:56,328
Kalevala's extended heathlands;

29
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:59,860
Better songs than he could compass;

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,392
Better than his father taught him.

31
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,924
This he heard with great displeasure,

32
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:10,456
And his heart was filled with envy

33
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,988
That the songs of Väinämöinen

34
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:17,520
Better than his own were reckoned.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,052
Then he went to seek his mother;

36
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:24,584
Sought her out, the aged woman,

37
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:28,116
And declared that he would journey,

38
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:31,648
And was eager to betake him,

39
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:35,180
Unto Väinölä's far dwellings,

40
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,712
That he might contend with Väinö.

41
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:42,244
But his father straight forbade him.

42
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:45,776
Both his father and his mother,

43
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:49,308
Thence to Väinölä to journey,

44
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,840
That he might contend with Väinö.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,372
"He will surely sing against you,

46
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:59,904
Sing against you, and will ban you,

47
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:03,436
Sink your mouth and head in snow-drifts,

48
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:06,968
And your hands in bitter tempest:

49
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:10,500
Till your hands and feet are stiffened,

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,972
And incapable of motion."

51
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:17,444
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

52
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,916
"Good the counsel of my father,

53
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,388
And my mother's counsel better;

54
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:27,860
Best of all my own opinion.

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,332
I will set myself against him,

56
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,804
And defy him to a contest,

57
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:38,276
I myself my songs will sing him,

58
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:41,748
I myself will speak my mantras;

59
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:45,220
Sing until the best of minstrels

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,692
Shall become the worst of singers.

61
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:52,164
Shoes of stone will I provide him,

62
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:55,636
Wooden trousers on his haunches;

63
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,108
On his breast a stony burden,

64
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:02,580
And a rock upon his shoulders;

65
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,052
Stony gloves his hands shall cover.

66
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:09,524
And his head a stony helmet."

67
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:12,996
Then he went his way unheeding,

68
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:16,468
Went his way, and fetched his gelding,

69
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:19,940
From whose mouth the fire was flashing,

70
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,412
'Neath whose legs the sparks were flying.

71
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:26,884
Then the fiery steed he harnessed,

72
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:30,356
To the golden sledge he yoked him,

73
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:33,828
In the sledge himself he mounted,

74
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:37,300
And upon the seat he sat him,

75
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,720
O'er the horse his whip he brandished,

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,140
With the beaded whip he smote him,

77
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,560
From the place the horse sprang quickly,

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,980
And he darted lightly forwards.

79
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,400
On he drove with thundering clatter,

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,820
As he drove a day, a second,

81
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,240
Driving also on the third day,

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,660
And at length upon the third day,

83
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,080
Came to Väinölä's sweet meadows,

84
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,500
Kalevala's extended heathlands.

85
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,920
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,340
He, the oldest of magicians,

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,760
As it chanced was driving onward,

88
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,180
Peacefully his course pursuing

89
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,600
On through Väinölä's sweet meadows,

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,020
Kalevala's extended heathlands.

91
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,440
Came the youthful Joukahainen

92
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,860
Driving on the road against him,

93
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,280
And the shafts were wedged together,

94
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,700
And the reins were all entangled,

95
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,120
And the collar jammed with collar,

96
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,540
And the runners dashed together.

97
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,960
Thus their progress was arrested,

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,380
Thus they halted and reflected;

99
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,800
Sweat dropped down upon the runners;

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,144
From the shafts the steam was rising.

101
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:09,488
Asked the aged Väinämöinen,

102
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:12,832
"Who are you, and what your lineage,

103
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,176
You who drive so reckless onward,

104
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,520
Utterly without reflection?

105
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,864
Broken are the horses' collars,

106
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:26,208
And the wooden runners likewise;

107
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,552
You have smashed my sledge to pieces.

108
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:32,896
Broke the sledge in which I travelled."

109
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:36,240
Then the youthful Joukahainen

110
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,584
Answered in the words which follow:

111
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:42,928
"I am youthful Joukahainen;

112
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:46,272
But yourself should also tell me,

113
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,616
What your race, and what your nation,

114
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:52,960
And from what vile stock you issue."

115
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,304
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

116
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:59,648
Told his name without concealment,

117
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:02,992
And began to speak as follows:

118
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:06,336
"Youth, if you are Joukahainen,

119
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:09,680
You should move aside a little.

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,024
For remember, you are younger."

121
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:16,368
But the youthful Joukahainen

122
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:19,712
Answered in the words which follow:

123
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:23,056
"Here of youthfulness we reck not;

124
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:26,400
Nought doth youth or age concern us,

125
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,736
He who highest stands in knowledge,

126
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:33,072
He whose wisdom is the greatest,

127
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:36,408
Let him keep the path before him,

128
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:39,744
And the other yield the passage.

129
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:43,080
If you are old Väinämöinen,

130
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,416
And the oldest of the minstrels,

131
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,752
Let us give ourselves to singing,

132
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:53,088
Let us now repeat our sayings,

133
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:56,424
That the one may teach the other.

134
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:59,760
And the one surpass the other,"

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,096
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

136
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:06,432
Answered in the words which follow:

137
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:09,768
"What can I myself accomplish

138
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:13,104
As a wise man or a singer?

139
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:16,440
I have passed my life in quiet,

140
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,776
Here among these very moorlands,

141
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:23,112
On the borders of my home-field

142
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:26,448
I have heard the cuckoo calling.

143
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:29,784
But apart from this at present,

144
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:33,120
I will ask you to inform me

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,456
What may be your greatest wisdom;

146
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:39,792
And the utmost of your knowledge?"

147
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,128
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

148
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:46,464
"Many things I know in fulness,

149
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:49,800
And I know with perfect clearness,

150
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,072
And my insight shows me plainly,

151
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:56,344
In the roof we find the smoke-hole,

152
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:59,616
And the fire is near the hearthstone.

153
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:02,888
"Joyful life the seal is leading,

154
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:06,160
In the waves there sports the sea-dog,

155
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,432
And he feeds upon the salmon,

156
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,704
And the powans round about him.

157
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:15,976
"Smooth the water loved by powans,

158
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:19,248
Smooth the surface, too, for salmon;

159
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:22,520
And in frost the pike is spawning,

160
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,792
Slimy fish in wintry weather.

161
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:29,064
Sluggish is the perch, the humpback,

162
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:32,336
In the depths it swims in autumn,

163
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:35,608
But it spawns in drought of summer,

164
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,880
Swimming slowly to the margin.

165
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,152
"If this does not yet suffice you,

166
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:45,424
I am wise in other matters,

167
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:48,696
And of weighty things can tell you.

168
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:51,968
In the north they plough with reindeer,

169
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:55,240
In the south the mare is useful,

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,512
And the elk In furthest Lapland.

171
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:01,784
"Trees I know on Pisa mountain,

172
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:05,056
Firs upon the rocks of Horna,

173
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,328
Tall the trees on Pisa mountain,

174
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:11,600
And the firs on rocks of Horna.

175
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,832
"Three great waterfalls I know of,

176
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:18,064
And as many lakes extensive,

177
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:21,296
And as many lofty mountains,

178
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:24,528
Underneath the vault of heaven.

179
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:27,760
Halläpyörä is in Hame,

180
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,992
Karjala has Kaatrakoski,

181
00:10:30,992 --> 00:10:34,224
But they do not match the Vuoksi,

182
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,456
There where Imatra is rushing."

183
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:40,688
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

184
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:43,920
"Childish tales, and woman's wisdom,

185
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,152
But for bearded men unsuited,

186
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,384
And for married men unfitted.

187
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,616
Tell me words of deepest wisdom.

188
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:56,848
Tell me now of things eternal."

189
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:00,080
Then the youthful Joukahainen

190
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,312
Answered in the words which follow:

191
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,544
"Well I know whence comes the titmouse,

192
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:09,776
That the titmouse is a birdie,

193
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:13,008
And a snake the hissing viper,

194
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:16,240
And the ruffe a fish in water.

195
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,472
And I know that hard is iron,

196
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:22,704
And that mud when black is bitter.

197
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:25,936
Painful, too, is boiling water,

198
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,168
And the heat of fire is hurtful,

199
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,400
Water is the oldest medicine,

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,592
Cataract's foam a magic potion;

201
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:38,784
The Creator's self a sorcerer,

202
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:41,976
Jumala the Great Magician.

203
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:45,168
"From the rock springs forth the water,

204
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:48,360
And the fire from heaven descendeth,

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,552
And from ore we get the iron,

206
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,744
And in hills we find the copper.

207
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:57,936
"Marshy country is the oldest,

208
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:01,128
And the first of trees the willow.

209
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:04,320
Pine-roots were the oldest houses,

210
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,512
And the earliest pots were stone ones."

211
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,704
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

212
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:13,896
Answered in the words which follow:

213
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:17,088
"Is there more that you can tell me,

214
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:20,280
Or is this the end of nonsense?"

215
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,472
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

216
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:26,664
"Many little things I wot of,

217
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,856
And the time I well remember

218
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:33,048
When 'twas I who ploughed the ocean,

219
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:36,240
Hollowed out the depths of ocean,

220
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,432
And I dug the caves for fishes,

221
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:42,624
And I sunk the deep abysses,

222
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:45,816
When the lakes I first created,

223
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:49,008
And I heaped the hills together.

224
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:52,200
And the rocky mountains fashioned.

225
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,344
"Then I stood with six great heroes!

226
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:58,488
I myself the seventh among them.

227
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:01,632
When the earth was first created,

228
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:04,776
And the air above expanded;

229
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:07,920
For the sky I fixed the pillars.

230
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,064
And I reared the arch of heaven,

231
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:14,208
To the moon assigned his journey,

232
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,352
Helped the sun upon his pathway,

233
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:20,496
To the Bear his place appointed,

234
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:23,640
And the stars in heaven I scattered,"

235
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,784
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

236
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:29,928
"Ay, indeed, a shameless liar!

237
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,072
You at least were never present

238
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:36,216
When the ocean first was furrowed,

239
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,360
And the ocean depths were hollowed.

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,504
And the caves were dug for fishes,

241
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:45,648
And the deep abysses sunken,

242
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,792
And the lakes were first created,

243
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,936
When the hills were heaped together,

244
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:55,080
And the rocky mountains fashioned.

245
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,224
"No one ever yet had seen you,

246
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:01,368
None had seen you, none had heard you.

247
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,512
When the earth was first created,

248
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,656
And the air above expanded,

249
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:10,800
When the posts of heaven were planted,

250
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,936
And the arch of heaven exalted,

251
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,072
When the moon was shown his pathway,

252
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:20,208
And the sun was taught to journey,

253
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,344
When the Bear was fixed in heaven,

254
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:26,480
And the stars in heaven were scattered."

255
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,616
But the youthful Joukahainen

256
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:32,752
Answered in the words which follow:

257
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,888
"If I fail in understanding,

258
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:39,024
I will seek it at the sword-point.

259
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:42,160
O thou aged Väinämöinen,

260
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,296
O thou very broad-mouthed minstrel,

261
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:48,432
Let us measure swords together,

262
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:51,568
Let the blade decide between us."

263
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:54,704
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

264
00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:57,840
"I have little cause to fret me

265
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,976
Either for your sword or wisdom,

266
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,112
For your sword-point or your judgment.

267
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,248
But, apart from this at present,

268
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:10,384
I will draw no sword upon you,

269
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:13,520
So contemptible a fellow,

270
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,656
And so pitiful a weakling."

271
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:19,792
Then the youthful Joukahainen

272
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,928
Shook his head, his mouth drawn crooked,

273
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:26,064
And he tossed his locks of blackness.

274
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:29,200
And he spake the words which follow:

275
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,272
"He who shuns the sword's decision,

276
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:35,344
Nor betakes him to his sword-blade,

277
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:38,416
To a swine I soon will sing him,

278
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,488
To a snouted swine transform him.

279
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:44,560
Heroes I have thus o'erpowered,

280
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,632
Hither will I drive and thither.

281
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:50,704
And will pitch them on the dunghill,

282
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:53,776
Grunting in the cowshed corner."

283
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:56,848
Angry then was Väinämöinen,

284
00:15:56,848 --> 00:15:59,920
Filled with wrath and indignation,

285
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,992
And himself commenced his singing,

286
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:06,064
And to speak his words of wisdom.

287
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:09,136
But he sang no childish ditties,

288
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,208
Children's songs and women's jesting,

289
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,280
But a song for bearded heroes,

290
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,352
Such as all the children sing not,

291
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,424
Nor a half the boys can master,

292
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:24,496
Nor a third can lovers compass,

293
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:27,568
In the days of dark misfortune,

294
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:30,640
When our life is near its ending.

295
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,712
Sang the aged Väinämöinen;

296
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:36,784
Lakes swelled up, and earth was shaken,

297
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:39,856
And the coppery mountains trembled.

298
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:42,928
And the mighty rocks resounded.

299
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:46,000
And the mountains clove asunder;

300
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,104
On the shore the stones were shivered.

301
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:52,208
Then he sang of Joukahainen,

302
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,312
Changed his runners into saplings,

303
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:58,416
And to willows changed the collar,

304
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,520
And the reins he turned to alder,

305
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,624
And he sang the sledge all gilded,

306
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,728
To the lake among the rushes,

307
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,832
And the whip, with beads embellished,

308
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,936
To a reed upon the water,

309
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:17,040
And the horse, with front white-spotted

310
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,144
To a stone beside the torrent.

311
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:23,248
Then he sang his sword, gold-hilted,

312
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:26,352
To a lightning-flash in heaven,

313
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:29,456
And his ornamented crossbow,

314
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:32,560
To a rainbow o'er the water,

315
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,664
And he sang his feathered arrows,

316
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:38,768
Into hawks that soar above him;

317
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:41,872
And his dog, with upturned muzzle,

318
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:44,976
Stands a stone in earth embedded.

319
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:48,080
From his head, his cap, by singing,

320
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,184
Next became a cloud above him,

321
00:17:51,184 --> 00:17:54,288
From his hands, his gloves, by singing,

322
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,392
Next were changed to water-lilies,

323
00:17:57,392 --> 00:18:00,496
And the blue coat he was wearing,

324
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,600
Floats a fleecy cloud in heaven,

325
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,660
And the handsome belt that girt him,

326
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,720
In the sky as stars he scattered.

327
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,780
As he sang, sank Joukahainen

328
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,840
Waist-deep in the swamp beneath him,

329
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,900
Hip-deep in the marshy meadow,

330
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,960
To his arm-pits in a quicksand.

331
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,020
Then indeed young Joukahainen

332
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,080
Knew at last, and comprehended;

333
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,140
And he knew his course was finished,

334
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,200
And his journey now was ended.

335
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,260
For in singing he was beaten,

336
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,320
By the aged Väinämöinen.

337
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,380
He would raise his foot to struggle

338
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,440
But he could no longer lift it;

339
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,500
Then he tried to lift the other,

340
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,560
But as shod with stone he felt it.

341
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,620
Then the youthful Joukahainen

342
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,680
Felt the greatest pain and anguish,

343
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,740
And he fell in grievous trouble,

344
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,800
And he spoke the words which follow:

345
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,860
"O thou wisest Väinämöinen,

346
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,920
O thou oldest of magicians,

347
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,980
Speak thy words of magic backwards,

348
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,040
And reverse thy songs of magic.

349
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,100
Loose me from this place of terror,

350
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,144
And release me from my torment.

351
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:26,188
I will pay the highest ransom,

352
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:29,232
And the fixed reward will give thee."

353
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,276
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

354
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,320
"What do you propose to give me,

355
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,364
If I turn my words of magic,

356
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:41,408
And reverse my songs of magic,

357
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:44,452
Loose you from this place of terror,

358
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:47,496
And release you from your torment?"

359
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:50,540
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

360
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,584
"I've two crossbows I could give you,

361
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:56,628
Ay, a pair of splendid crossbows,

362
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,672
One shoots forth with passing quickness,

363
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:02,716
Surely hits the mark the other.

364
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:05,760
If it please you, choose between them."

365
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,804
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

366
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:11,848
"No, your bows I do not covet,

367
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,892
For the wretched bows I care not;

368
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,936
I myself have plenty of them.

369
00:20:17,936 --> 00:20:20,980
All the walls are decked with crossbows,

370
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,024
All the pegs are hung with crossbows;

371
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:27,068
In the woods they wander hunting,

372
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:30,112
Nor a hero needs to span them."

373
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:33,156
Then the youthful Joukahainen

374
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:36,200
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

375
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,236
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

376
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:42,272
"I have yet two boats to offer;

377
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:45,308
Splendid boats, as I can witness,

378
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:48,344
One is light, and fit for racing,

379
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:51,380
Heavy loads will bear the other;

380
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,416
If it please you, choose between them."

381
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,452
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

382
00:20:57,452 --> 00:21:00,488
"No, your boats I do not covet,

383
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:03,524
And I will not choose between them,

384
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:06,560
I myself have plenty of them.

385
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,596
All the staves are full already,

386
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:12,632
Every creek is crowded with them,

387
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,668
Boats to face the gale adapted,

388
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,704
Boats against the wind that travel."

389
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:21,740
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

390
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,776
in the swamp he sang yet deeper.

391
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:27,812
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

392
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:30,848
"I have still two noble stallions;

393
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:33,884
Ay, a pair of handsome horses;

394
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,920
One of these of matchless swiftness,

395
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,956
And the other best in harness.

396
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:42,992
If it please you, choose between them."

397
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:46,028
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

398
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:49,064
"No, I do not want your horses;

399
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:52,100
Do not need your steeds, white-footed.

400
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,112
I myself have plenty of them.

401
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:58,124
Every stall has now its tenant,

402
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:01,136
Every stable's filled with horses,

403
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:04,148
With their backs like water shining;

404
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:07,160
Lakes of fat upon their haunches."

405
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,172
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

406
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:13,184
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

407
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:16,196
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

408
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:19,208
"O thou aged Väinämöinen,

409
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,220
Speak thy words of magic backwards,

410
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,232
And reverse thy songs of magic.

411
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,244
I will give a golden helmet,

412
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:31,256
And a hat filled up with silver,

413
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:34,268
Which my father won in warfare,

414
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:37,280
Which he won in battle-struggle."

415
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,292
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

416
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,304
"No, I do not want your silver,

417
00:22:43,304 --> 00:22:46,316
And for gold, I only scorn it.

418
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:49,328
I myself have both in plenty.

419
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:52,340
Every storeroom crammed with treasure.

420
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,352
Every chest is overflowing.

421
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:58,364
Gold as ancient as the moonlight,

422
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:01,376
Silver with the sun coeval."

423
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,388
Then the youthful Joukahainen

424
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:07,400
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

425
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,404
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

426
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:13,408
"O thou aged Väinämöinen,

427
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,412
Loose me from this place of terror,

428
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:19,416
And release me from my torment.

429
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,420
All my stacks at home I'll give thee,

430
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,424
And my fields I likewise promise,

431
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:28,428
All to save my life I offer,

432
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:31,432
If you will accept my ransom."

433
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:34,436
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

434
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:37,440
"No, your barns I do not covet,

435
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,444
And your fields are 'neath my notice,

436
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:43,448
I myself have plenty of them.

437
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:46,452
Fields are mine in all directions,

438
00:23:46,452 --> 00:23:49,456
Stocks are reared on every fallow,

439
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:52,460
And my own fields please me better,

440
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,464
And my stacks of corn are finest."

441
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:58,468
Then the youthful Joukahainen

442
00:23:58,468 --> 00:24:01,472
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

443
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:04,476
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

444
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,480
Felt at length the greatest anguish,

445
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,484
Chin-deep in the swamp while sinking,

446
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:13,488
In the mud his beard was draggled,

447
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:16,492
In the moss his mouth was sunken,

448
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:19,496
And his teeth among the tree-roots.

449
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:22,500
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

450
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,492
"O thou wisest Väinämöinen,

451
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:28,484
O thou oldest of magicians,

452
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:31,476
Sing once more thy songs of magic,

453
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:34,468
Grant the life of one so wretched,

454
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:37,460
And release me from my prison.

455
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,452
In the stream my feet are sunken,

456
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:43,444
With the sand my eyes are smarting.

457
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:46,436
"Speak thy words of magic backwards,

458
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:49,428
Break the spell that overwhelms me!

459
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:52,420
You shall have my sister Aino,

460
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,412
I will give my mother's daughter.

461
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,404
She shall dust your chamber for you,

462
00:24:58,404 --> 00:25:01,396
Sweep the flooring with her besom,

463
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:04,388
Keep the milk-pots all in order;

464
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:07,380
And shall wash your garments for you.

465
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,372
Golden fabrics she shall weave you,

466
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:13,364
And shall bake you cakes of honey."

467
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:16,356
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

468
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:19,348
Heard his words, and grew full joyful,

469
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:22,340
Since to tend his age was promised

470
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,332
Joukahainen's lovely sister.

471
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:28,324
On the stone of joy he sat him,

472
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:31,316
On the stone of song he rested,

473
00:25:31,316 --> 00:25:34,308
Sang an hour, and sang a second,

474
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:37,300
And again he sang a third time:

475
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,288
Thus reversed his words of magic,

476
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,276
And dissolved the spell completely.

477
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,264
Then the youthful Joukahainen

478
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:49,252
From the mud his chin uplifted,

479
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:52,240
And his beard he disentangled,

480
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,228
From the rock his steed led forward,

481
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:58,216
Drew his sledge from out the bushes,

482
00:25:58,216 --> 00:26:01,204
From the reeds his whip unloosing.

483
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:04,192
Then upon his sledge he mounted,

484
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:07,180
And upon the seat he sat him,

485
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,168
And with gloomy thoughts he hastened,

486
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:13,156
With a heart all sad and doleful,

487
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,144
Homeward to his dearest mother,

488
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:19,132
Unto her, the aged woman.

489
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:22,120
On he drove with noise and tumult,

490
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,108
Home he drove in consternation,

491
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:28,096
And he broke the sledge to pieces,

492
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:31,084
At the door the shafts were broken.

493
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:34,072
Then the noise alarmed his mother,

494
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:37,060
And his father came and asked him,

495
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,048
"Recklessly the sledge was broken;

496
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:43,036
Did you break the shafts on purpose?

497
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:46,024
Wherefore do you drive so rashly,

498
00:26:46,024 --> 00:26:49,012
And arrive at home so madly?"

499
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:52,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,972
Could not keep his tears from flowing;

501
00:26:54,972 --> 00:26:57,944
Sad he bowed his head in sorrow,

502
00:26:57,944 --> 00:27:00,916
And his cap awry he shifted,

503
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:03,888
And his lips were dry and stiffened,

504
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,860
O'er his mouth his nose was drooping.

505
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,832
Then his mother came and asked him

506
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:12,804
Wherefore was he sunk in sorrow.

507
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:15,776
"O my son, why weep so sadly?

508
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:18,748
O my darling, why so troubled,

509
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:21,720
With thy lips so dry and stiffened,

510
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,692
O'er thy mouth thy nose thus drooping?"

511
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,664
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

512
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:30,636
"O my mother, who hast borne me,

513
00:27:30,636 --> 00:27:33,608
There is cause for what has happened,

514
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,580
For the sorcerer has o'ercome me.

515
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,552
Cause enough have I for weeping,

516
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:42,524
And the sorcerer's brought me sorrow.

517
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:45,496
I myself must weep for ever,

518
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:48,468
And must pass my life in mourning,

519
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:51,440
For my very sister Aino,

520
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,412
She, my dearest mother's daughter,

521
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:57,384
I have pledged to Väinämöinen,

522
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,356
As the consort of the minstrel,

523
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:03,328
To support his feeble footsteps,

524
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:06,300
And to wait upon him always."

525
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,260
Joyous clapped her hands his mother,

526
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,220
Both her hands she rubbed together,

527
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,180
And she spoke the words which follow:

528
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,140
"Do not weep, my son, my dearest,

529
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,100
For thy tears are quite uncalled for.

530
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,060
Little cause have we to sorrow,

531
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,020
For the hope I long have cherished.

532
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,980
All my lifetime I have wished it,

533
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,940
And have hoped this high-born hero

534
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,900
Might akin to us be reckoned,

535
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,860
And the minstrel Väinämöinen

536
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,820
Might become my daughter's husband."

537
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,780
But when Joukahainen's sister

538
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,740
Heard, she wept in deepest sorrow,

539
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,700
Wept one day, and wept a second,

540
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,660
At the threshold ever weeping,

541
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,620
Wept in overwhelming sorrow,

542
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,580
In the sadness of her spirit.

543
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,540
Then her mother said consoling,

544
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,500
"Wherefore weep, my little Aino?

545
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,460
You have gained a valiant bridegroom,

546
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,420
And the home of one most noble,

547
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,380
Where you'll look from out the window,

548
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,340
Sitting on the bench and talking."

549
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,300
But her daughter heard and answered,

550
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,255
"O my mother who hast borne me,

551
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:26,210
Therefore have I cause for weeping,

552
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,165
Weeping for the beauteous tresses,

553
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:32,119
Now my youthful head adorning,

554
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:35,074
And my hair so soft and glossy,

555
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:38,029
Which must now be wholly hidden,

556
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:40,984
While I still am young and blooming.

557
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:43,939
"Then must I through lifetime sorrow

558
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:46,894
For the splendour of the sunlight,

559
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:49,848
And the moonbeam's charming lustre

560
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:52,803
And the glory of the heavens,

561
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:55,758
Which I leave, while still so youthful,

562
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:58,713
And as child must quite abandon,

563
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,668
I must leave my brother's work-room,

564
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:04,623
Just beyond my father's window."

565
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:07,577
Said the mother to the daughter,

566
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:10,532
To the girl the crone made answer,

567
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:13,487
"Cast away this foolish sorrow,

568
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:16,442
Cease your weeping, all uncalled for,

569
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:19,397
Little cause have you for sorrow,

570
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:22,352
Little cause for lamentation.

571
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:25,306
God's bright sun is ever shining

572
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:28,261
On the world in other regions,

573
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:31,216
Shines on other doors and windows

574
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:34,171
Than your father's or your brother's;

575
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:37,126
Berries grow on every mountain,

576
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,081
Strawberries on the plains are growing,

577
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:43,035
You can pluck them in your sorrow

578
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:45,990
Wheresoe'er your steps may lead you;

579
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,945
Not alone on father's acres,

580
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,900
Or upon your brother's clearings."

581
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,200
Not alone on father's acres,

582
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Or upon your brother's clearings."
