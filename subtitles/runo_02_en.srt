1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,725
Then did Väinämöinen, rising,

2
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:22,850
Set his feet upon the surface

3
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,975
Of a sea-encircled island,

4
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:31,100
In a region bare of forest.

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,225
There he dwelt, while years passed over,

6
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:39,350
And his dwelling he established

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,475
On the silent, voiceless island,

8
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:47,600
In a barren, treeless country.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,725
Then he pondered and reflected,

10
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:55,850
In his mind he turned it over,

11
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,975
"Who shall sow this barren country,

12
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:04,100
Thickly scattering seeds around him?"

13
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,225
Pellervoinen, earth-begotten,

14
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:12,350
Sampsa, youth of smallest stature,

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,475
Came to sow the barren country,

16
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:20,600
Thickly scattering seeds around him.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,725
Down he stooped the seeds to scatter,

18
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:28,850
On the land and in the marshes,

19
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,975
Both in flat and sandy regions,

20
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:37,100
And in hard and rocky places.

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,225
On the hills he sowed the pine-trees,

22
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:45,350
On the knolls he sowed the fir-trees,

23
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,475
And in sandy places heather;

24
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:53,600
Leafy saplings in the valleys.

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,444
In the dales he sowed the birch-trees,

26
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:01,288
In the loose earth sowed the alders,

27
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,132
Where the ground was damp the cherries,

28
00:02:05,132 --> 00:02:08,976
Likewise in the marshes, sallows.

29
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:12,820
Rowan-trees in holy places,

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,664
Willows in the fenny regions,

31
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:20,508
Juniper in stony districts,

32
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:24,352
Oaks upon the banks of rivers.

33
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:28,196
Now the trees sprang up and flourished,

34
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:32,040
And the saplings sprouted bravely.

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,884
With their bloom the firs were loaded,

36
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:39,728
And the pines their boughs extended.

37
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:43,572
In the dales the birch was sprouting,

38
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:47,416
In the loose earth rose the alders,

39
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:51,260
Where the ground was damp the cherries,

40
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,104
Juniper in stony districts,

41
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,948
Loaded with its lovely berries;

42
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:02,792
And the cherries likewise fruited.

43
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:06,636
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

44
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:10,480
Came to view the work in progress,

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,324
Where the land was sown by Sampsa,

46
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:18,168
And where Pellervoinen laboured.

47
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:22,012
While he saw the trees had flourished,

48
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:25,856
And the saplings sprouted bravely,

49
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:29,700
Yet had Jumala's tree, the oak-tree,

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,392
Not struck down its root and sprouted.

51
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:37,084
Therefore to its fate he left it,

52
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:40,776
Left it to enjoy its freedom,

53
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:44,468
And he waited three nights longer,

54
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,160
And as many days he waited.

55
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,852
Then he went and gazed around him,

56
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:55,544
When the week was quite completed.

57
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:59,236
Yet had Jumala's tree, the oak-tree,

58
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:02,928
Not struck down its root and sprouted.

59
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,620
Then he saw four lovely maidens;

60
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,312
Five, like brides, from water rising;

61
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:14,004
And they mowed the grassy meadow,

62
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,696
Down they cut the dewy herbage,

63
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:21,388
On the cloud-encompassed headland,

64
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:25,080
On the peaceful island's summit,

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,772
What they mowed, they raked together,

66
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:32,464
And in heaps the hay collected.

67
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:36,156
From the ocean rose up Tursas,

68
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:39,848
From the waves arose the hero,

69
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:43,540
And the heaps of hay he kindled,

70
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,232
And the flames arose in fury.

71
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:50,924
All was soon consumed to ashes,

72
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,616
Till the sparks were quite extinguished.

73
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:58,308
Then among the heaps of ashes,

74
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:02,000
In the dryness of the ashes,

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,560
There a tender germ he planted,

76
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Tender germ, of oak an acorn

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,680
Whence the beauteous plant sprang upward,

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,240
And the sapling grew and flourished,

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,800
As from earth a strawberry rises,

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,360
And it forked in both directions.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,920
Then the branches wide extended,

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,480
And the leaves were thickly scattered,

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,040
And the summit rose to heaven,

84
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,600
And its leaves in air expanded.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,160
In their course the clouds it hindered,

86
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,720
And the driving clouds impeded,

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,280
And it hid the shining sunlight,

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,840
And the gleaming of the moonlight.

89
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,400
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

90
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Pondered deeply and reflected,

91
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,520
"Is there none to fell the oak-tree,

92
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,080
And o'erthrow the tree majestic?

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,640
Sad is now the life of mortals,

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,200
And for fish to swim is dismal,

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,760
Since the air is void of sunlight,

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,320
And the gleaming of the moonlight."

97
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,880
But they could not find a hero,

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,440
Nowhere find a man so mighty,

99
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,000
Who could fell the giant oak-tree,

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,504
With its hundred spreading branches.

101
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:38,008
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

102
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:41,512
Spoke the very words which follow;

103
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:45,016
"Noble mother, who hast borne me,

104
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:48,520
Luonnotar, who me hast nurtured;

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,024
Send me powers from out the ocean:

106
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:55,528
(Numerous are the powers of ocean)

107
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:59,032
So that they may fell the oak-tree,

108
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,536
And destroy the tree so baneful,

109
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:06,040
That the sun may shine upon us.

110
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,544
And the pleasant moonlight glimmer."

111
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:13,048
Then a man arose from ocean,

112
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:16,552
From the waves a hero started,

113
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:20,056
Not the hugest of the hugest,

114
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:23,560
Nor the smallest of the smallest.

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,064
As a man's thumb was his stature;

116
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:30,568
Lofty as the span of woman.

117
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:34,072
Decked his head a helm of copper,

118
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:37,576
On his feet were boots of copper,

119
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:41,080
On his hands were copper gauntlets.

120
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,584
Gloves adorned with copper tracings;

121
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:48,088
Round his waist his belt was copper;

122
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:51,592
In his belt his axe was copper;

123
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:55,096
And the haft thereof was thumb-long,

124
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:58,600
And the blade thereof was nail-long.

125
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,072
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

126
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:05,544
Deeply pondered and reflected:

127
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:09,016
"While he seems a man in semblance,

128
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:12,488
And a hero in appearance,

129
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:15,960
Yet his height is but a thumb-length,

130
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,432
Scarce as lofty as an ox-hoof."

131
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,904
Then he spoke the words which follow,

132
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:26,376
And expressed himself in this wise:

133
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:29,848
"Who are you, my little fellow,

134
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:33,320
Most contemptible of heroes,

135
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,792
Than a dead man scarcely stronger;

136
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:40,264
And your beauty all has vanished."

137
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,736
Then the puny man from ocean,

138
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:47,208
Hero of the floods, made answer:

139
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,680
"I'm a man as you behold me,

140
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,152
Small, but mighty water-hero,

141
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:57,624
I have come to fell the oak-tree,

142
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:01,096
And to splinter it to fragments."

143
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:04,568
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

144
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:08,040
Answered in the words which follow:

145
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,512
"You have hardly been created,

146
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,984
Neither made, nor so proportioned,

147
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:18,456
As to fell this mighty oak-tree,

148
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,928
Overthrow the tree stupendous."

149
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,400
Scarcely had the words been spoken,

150
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,792
While his gaze was fixed upon him,

151
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:32,184
When the man transformed before him,

152
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,576
And became a mighty hero.

153
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,968
While his feet the earth were stamping,

154
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:42,360
To the clouds his head he lifted,

155
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,752
To his knees his beard was flowing,

156
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,144
To his spurs his locks descended.

157
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:52,536
Fathom-wide his eyes were parted,

158
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:55,928
Fathom-wide his trousers measured;

159
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,320
Round his knee the girth was greater,

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,712
And around his hip 'twas doubled.

161
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:06,104
Then he sharpened keen the axe-blade,

162
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:09,496
Brought the polished blade to sharpness;

163
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:12,888
Six the stones on which he ground it,

164
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:16,280
Seven the stones on which he whet it.

165
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,672
Then the man stepped forward lightly,

166
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:23,064
Hastened on to do his mission;

167
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:26,456
Wide his trousers, and they fluttered

168
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:29,848
Round his legs as onward strode he,

169
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:33,240
And the first step taken, brought him

170
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,632
To the shore so soft and sandy;

171
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:40,024
With the second stride he landed

172
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:43,416
On the dun ground further inland,

173
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,808
And the third step brought him quickly,

174
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:50,200
Where the oak itself was rooted.

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,532
With his axe he smote the oak-tree,

176
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:56,864
With his sharpened blade he hewed it;

177
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,196
Once he smote it, twice he smote it,

178
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:03,528
And the third stroke wholly cleft it.

179
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,860
From the axe the flame was flashing,

180
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,192
Flame was bursting from the oak-tree,

181
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:13,524
As he strove to fell the oak-tree,

182
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:16,856
Overthrow the tree stupendous.

183
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:20,188
Thus the third blow was delivered,

184
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:23,520
And the oak-tree fell before him,

185
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,852
For the mighty tree was shattered,

186
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,184
And the hundred boughs had fallen,

187
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:33,516
And the trunk extended eastward,

188
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,848
And the summit to the north-west,

189
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:40,180
And the leaves were scattered southwards,

190
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,512
And the branches to the northward.

191
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:46,844
He who took a branch from off it,

192
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:50,176
Took prosperity unceasing,

193
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,508
What was broken from the summit,

194
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:56,840
Gave unending skill in magic;

195
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,172
He who broke a leafy branchlet,

196
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,504
Gathered with it love unending.

197
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:06,836
What remained of fragments scattered,

198
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:10,168
Chips of wood, and broken splinters,

199
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:13,500
On the bright expanse of ocean,

200
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,836
On the far-extending billows,

201
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,172
In the breeze were gently rocking,

202
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,508
On the waves were lightly drifted.

203
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:26,844
Like the boats on ocean's surface,

204
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:30,180
Like the ships amid the sea-waves.

205
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,516
Northward drove the wind the fragments,

206
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:36,852
Where the little maid of Pohja,

207
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:40,188
Stood on beach, and washed her head-dress,

208
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:43,524
And she washed her clothes and rinsed them,

209
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,860
On the shingle by the ocean,

210
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,196
On a tongue of land projecting.

211
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:53,532
On the waves she saw the fragments,

212
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:56,868
Put them in her birchbark wallet,

213
00:12:56,868 --> 00:13:00,204
In her wallet took them homeward;

214
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:03,540
In the well-closed yard she stored them,

215
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,876
For the arrows of the sorcerer,

216
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:10,212
For the chase to furnish weapons.

217
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:13,548
When the oak at last had fallen,

218
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:16,884
And the evil tree was levelled,

219
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:20,220
Once again the sun shone brightly,

220
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,556
And the pleasant moonlight glimmered,

221
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:26,892
And the clouds extended widely,

222
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:30,228
And the rainbow spanned the heavens,

223
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:33,564
O'er the cloud-encompassed headland,

224
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,900
And the island's misty summit.

225
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,212
Then the wastes were clothed with verdure,

226
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:43,524
And the woods grew up and flourished;

227
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:46,836
Leaves on trees and grass in meadows.

228
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:50,148
In the trees the birds were singing,

229
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:53,460
Loudly sang the cheery throstle;

230
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,772
In the tree-tops called the cuckoo.

231
00:13:56,772 --> 00:14:00,084
Then the earth brought forth her berries;

232
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:03,396
Shone the fields with golden blossoms;

233
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:06,708
Herbs of every species flourished;

234
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,020
Plants and trees of all descriptions;

235
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,332
But the barley would not flourish,

236
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,644
Nor the precious seed would ripen.

237
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:19,956
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

238
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:23,268
Walked around, and deeply pondered,

239
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,580
By the blue waves' sandy margin,

240
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,892
On the mighty ocean's border,

241
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:33,204
And six grains of corn he found there,

242
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,516
Seven fine seeds of corn he found there,

243
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:39,828
On the borders of the ocean,

244
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:43,140
On the yielding sandy margin.

245
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,452
In a marten's skin he placed them,

246
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,764
From the leg of summer squirrel.

247
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,076
Then he went to sow the fallows;

248
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:56,388
On the ground the seeds to scatter,

249
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:59,700
Near to Kaleva's own fountain,

250
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,012
And upon the field of Osmo.

251
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:06,324
From a tree there chirped the titmouse:

252
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:09,636
"Osmo's barley will not flourish,

253
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:12,948
Nor will Kaleva's oats prosper,

254
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,260
While untilled remains the country,

255
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,572
And uncleared remains the forest,

256
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:22,884
Nor the fire has burned it over."

257
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:26,196
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

258
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,508
Ground his axe-blade edge to sharpness

259
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,820
And began to fell the forest,

260
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,132
Toiling hard to clear the country.

261
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:39,444
All the lovely trees he levelled,

262
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:42,756
Sparing but a single birch-tree,

263
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:46,068
That the birds might rest upon it,

264
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:49,380
And from thence might call the cuckoo.

265
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,692
In the sky there soared an eagle,

266
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,004
Of the birds of air the greatest,

267
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:59,316
And he came and gazed around him.

268
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:02,628
"Wherefore is the work unfinished,

269
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,940
And the birch-tree still unfallen?

270
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,252
Wherefore spare the beauteous birch-tree?"

271
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:12,564
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

272
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:15,876
"Therefore is the birch left standing,

273
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:19,188
That the birds may perch upon it;

274
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,500
All the birds of air may rest there."

275
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,784
Said the bird of air, the eagle,

276
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,068
"Very wisely hast thou acted,

277
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,352
Thus to leave the birch-tree standing

278
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:35,636
And the lovely tree unfallen,

279
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:38,920
That the birds may perch upon it,

280
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,204
And that I myself may rest there."

281
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:45,488
Then the bird of air struck fire,

282
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:48,772
And the flames rose up in brightness,

283
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:52,056
While the north wind fanned the forest,

284
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:55,340
And the north-east wind blew fiercely.

285
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,624
All the trees were burned to ashes,

286
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:01,908
Till the sparks were quite extinguished.

287
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:05,192
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

288
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,476
Took the six seeds from his satchel,

289
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:11,760
And he took the seven small kernels,

290
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,044
From the marten's skin he took them,

291
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:18,328
From the leg of summer squirrel,

292
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,612
From the leg of summer ermine.

293
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:24,896
Then he went to sow the country,

294
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:28,180
And to scatter seeds around him,

295
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,464
And he spoke the words which follow;

296
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:34,748
"Now I stoop the seeds to scatter,

297
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:38,032
As from the Creator's fingers,

298
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:41,316
From the hand of Him Almighty,

299
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:44,600
That the country may be fertile,

300
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,832
And the corn may grow and flourish.

301
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:51,064
"Patroness of lowland country,

302
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:54,296
Old one of the plains; Earth-Mother,

303
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:57,528
Let the tender blade spring upward,

304
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:00,760
Let the earth support and cherish.

305
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,992
Might of earth will never fail us,

306
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:07,224
Never while the earth existeth,

307
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,456
When the Givers are propitious.

308
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,688
And Creation's daughters aid us.

309
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:16,920
"Rise, O earth; from out thy slumber,

310
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,152
Field of the Creator, rouse thee,

311
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:23,384
Make the blade arise and flourish.

312
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:26,616
Let the stalks grow up and lengthen,

313
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,848
That the ears may grow by thousands,

314
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:33,080
Yet a hundredfold increasing,

315
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,312
By my ploughing and my sowing,

316
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:39,544
In return for all my labour.

317
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:42,776
"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest.

318
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:46,008
Father, thou in heaven abiding,

319
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:49,240
Thou to whom the clouds are subject.

320
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,472
Of the scattered clouds the ruler,

321
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:55,704
All thy clouds do thou assemble,

322
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:58,936
In the light make clear thy counsel,

323
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:02,168
Send thou forth a cloud from eastwards

324
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:05,400
In the north-west let one gather,

325
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,632
Send thou others from the westward,

326
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:11,864
Let them drive along from southward.

327
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:15,096
Send the light rain forth from heaven,

328
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:18,328
Let the clouds distil with honey,

329
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:21,560
That the corn may sprout up strongly,

330
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,792
And the stalks may wave and rustle."

331
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:28,024
Ukko, then, of Gods the highest,

332
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:31,256
Father of the highest heaven,

333
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:34,488
Heard, and all the clouds assembled.

334
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:37,720
In the light made clear his counsel,

335
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,952
And he sent a cloud from eastward.

336
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:44,184
In the north-west let one gather,

337
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,416
Others, too, he sent from westward,

338
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,648
Let them drive along from southward,

339
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,880
Linked them edge to edge together,

340
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,112
And he closed the rifts between them.

341
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,344
Then he sent the rain from heaven,

342
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:03,576
And the clouds distilled sweet honey,

343
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:06,808
That the corn might sprout up stronger,

344
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:10,040
And the stalks might wave and rustle.

345
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,272
Thus the sprouting germ was nourished,

346
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:16,504
And the rustling stalks grew upward,

347
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:19,736
From the soft earth of the cornfield.

348
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:22,968
Through the toil of Väinämöinen.

349
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:26,200
After this, two days passed over,

350
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,438
After two nights, after three nights,

351
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,676
When the week was full completed,

352
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:35,914
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

353
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:39,152
Wandered forth to see the progress;

354
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:42,390
How his ploughing and his sowing

355
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,628
And his labours had resulted.

356
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:48,866
There he found the barley growing,

357
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:52,103
And the ears were all six-cornered,

358
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:55,341
And the stalks were all three-knotted.

359
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:58,579
Then the aged Väinämöinen

360
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:01,817
Wandered on and gazed around him,

361
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:05,055
And the cuckoo, bird of springtime,

362
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,293
Came and saw the birch-tree growing.

363
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,531
"Wherefore is the birch left standing,

364
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,769
And unfelled the slender birch-tree?"

365
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,007
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

366
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,245
"Therefore is the birch left standing,

367
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,483
And unfelled the slender birch-tree,

368
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,721
As a perch for thee, O Cuckoo;

369
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,959
Whence the cuckoo's cry may echo.

370
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,197
From thy sand-hued throat cry sweetly,

371
00:21:34,197 --> 00:21:37,434
With thy silver voice call loudly,

372
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:40,672
With thy tin-like voice cry clearly,

373
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:43,910
Call at morning, call at evening,

374
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,148
And at noontide call thou likewise,

375
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:50,386
To rejoice my plains surrounding,

376
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:53,624
That my woods may grow more cheerful,

377
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:56,862
That my coast may grow more wealthy,

378
00:21:56,862 --> 00:22:00,100
And my region grow more fruitful."

379
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,600
That my coast may grow more wealthy,

380
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
And my region grow more fruitful."
