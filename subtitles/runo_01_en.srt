1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,417
I am driven by my longing,

2
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:20,233
And my understanding urges

3
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:24,050
That I should commence my singing;

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,867
And begin my recitation.

5
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:31,683
I will sing the people's legends,

6
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:35,500
And the ballads of the nation.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,317
To my mouth the words are flowing,

8
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:43,133
And the words are gently falling,

9
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,950
Quickly as my tongue can shape them,

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,767
And between my teeth emerging.

11
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:54,583
Dearest friend, and much-loved brother,

12
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:58,400
Best beloved of all companions,

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,217
Come and let us sing together,

14
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:06,033
Let us now begin our converse,

15
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,850
Since at length we meet together,

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,667
From two widely sundered regions.

17
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:17,483
Rarely can we meet together,

18
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:21,300
Rarely one can meet the other,

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,117
In these dismal Northern regions,

20
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:28,933
In the dreary land of Pohja.

21
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:32,750
Let us clasp our hands together,

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,567
Let us interlock our fingers;

23
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:40,383
Let us sing a cheerful measure,

24
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:44,200
Let us use our best endeavours,

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,852
While our dear ones hearken to us,

26
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:51,504
And our loved ones are instructed,

27
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:55,156
While the young are standing round us,

28
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,808
Of the rising generation,

29
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:02,460
Let them learn the words of magic.

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,112
And recall our songs and legends,

31
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:09,764
Of the belt of Väinämöinen,

32
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:13,416
Of the forge of Ilmarinen,

33
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,068
And of Kaukomieli's sword-point,

34
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,720
And of Joukahainen's crossbow:

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,372
Of the utmost bounds of Pohja,

36
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:28,024
And of Kalevala's wide heathlands.

37
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:31,676
These my father sang aforetime,

38
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:35,328
As he carved his hatchet's handle,

39
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,980
And my mother taught me likewise,

40
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,632
As she turned around her spindle,

41
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:46,284
When upon the floor, an infant,

42
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,936
At her knees she saw me tumbling,

43
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,588
As a helpless child, milk-bearded,

44
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:57,240
As a babe with mouth all milky.

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,892
Tales about the Sampo failed not,

46
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,544
Nor the magic spells of Louhi.

47
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:08,196
Old at length became the Sampo;

48
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:11,848
Louhi vanished with her magic;

49
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,500
Vipunen while singing perished;

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,060
Lemminkainen in his follies.

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,620
There are many other legends;

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,180
Songs I learned of magic import;

53
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,740
Some beside the pathway gathered;

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,300
Others broken from the heather;

55
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,860
Others wrested from the bushes;

56
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,420
Others taken from the saplings,

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,980
Gathered from the springing verdure,

58
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,540
Or collected from the by-ways,

59
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,100
As I passed along as herd-boy,

60
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,660
As a child in cattle pastures,

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,220
On the hillocks, rich in honey,

62
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,780
On the hills, for ever golden,

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,340
After Muurikki, the black one,

64
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,900
By the side of dappled Kimmo.

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,460
Then the Frost his songs recited,

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,020
And the rain its legends taught me;

67
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,580
Other songs the winds have wafted,

68
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,140
Or the ocean waves have drifted;

69
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,700
And their songs the birds have added,

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,260
And the magic spells the tree-tops.

71
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,820
In a ball I bound them tightly;

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,380
And arranged them in a bundle;

73
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,940
On my little sledge I laid it,

74
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,500
On my sleigh I laid the bundle;

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,944
Home upon the sledge I brought it,

76
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:51,388
Then into the barn conveyed it;

77
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:54,832
In the storehouse loft I placed it,

78
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:58,276
In a little box of copper.

79
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:01,720
In the cold my song was resting,

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,164
Long remained in darkness hidden.

81
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:08,608
I must draw the songs from Coldness,

82
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,052
From the Frost must I withdraw them,

83
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:15,496
Bring my box into the chamber,

84
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:18,940
On the bench-end lay the casket,

85
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,384
Underneath this noble gable,

86
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:25,828
Underneath this roof of beauty.

87
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:29,272
Shall I ope my box of legends,

88
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:32,716
And my chest where lays are treasured?

89
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:36,160
Is the ball to be unravelled,

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,604
And the bundle's knot unfastened?

91
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:43,048
Then I'll sing so grand a ballad,

92
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:46,492
That it wondrously shall echo,

93
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:49,936
While the ryebread I am eating,

94
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:53,380
And the beer of barley drinking.

95
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,824
But though ale should not be brought me,

96
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,268
And though beer should not be offered,

97
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:03,712
I will sing, though dry my throttle,

98
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:07,156
Or will sing, with water only,

99
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:10,600
To enhance our evening's pleasure,

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,984
Celebrate the daylight's beauty,

101
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:17,368
Or the beauty of the daybreak,

102
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:20,752
When another day is dawning.

103
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:24,136
I have often heard related,

104
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:27,520
And have heard the song recited,

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,904
How the nights closed ever lonely,

106
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:34,288
And the days were shining lonely.

107
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:37,672
Only born was Väinämöinen,

108
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:41,056
And revealed the bard immortal,

109
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:44,440
Sprung from the divine Creatrix,

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,824
Born of Ilmatar, his mother.

111
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,208
Air's young daughter was a virgin,

112
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,592
Fairest daughter of Creation.

113
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:57,976
Long did she abide a virgin,

114
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:01,360
All the long days of her girlhood,

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,744
In the Air's own spacious mansions,

116
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:08,128
In those far extending regions.

117
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,512
Wearily the time passed ever.

118
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:14,896
And her life became a burden,

119
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:18,280
Dwelling evermore so lonely,

120
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,664
Always living as a maiden,

121
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:25,048
In the Air's own spacious mansions,

122
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:28,432
In those far-extending deserts.

123
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:31,816
After this the maid descending,

124
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:35,200
Sank upon the tossing billows,

125
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,532
On the open ocean's surface,

126
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,864
On the wide expanse of water.

127
00:07:41,864 --> 00:07:45,196
Then a storm arose in fury,

128
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:48,528
From the East a mighty tempest,

129
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,860
And the sea was wildly foaming,

130
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,192
And the waves dashed ever higher.

131
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,524
Thus the tempest rocked the virgin,

132
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:01,856
And the billows drove the maiden,

133
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,188
O'er the ocean's azure surface,

134
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:08,520
On the crest of foaming billows,

135
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,852
Till the wind that blew around her,

136
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:15,184
And the sea woke life within her.

137
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:18,516
Then she bore her heavy burden,

138
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:21,848
And the pain it brought upon her,

139
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:25,180
Seven long centuries together,

140
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,512
Nine times longer than a lifetime.

141
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,844
Yet no child was fashioned from her,

142
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,176
And no offspring was perfected.

143
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:38,508
Thus she swam, the Water-Mother,

144
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,840
East she swam, and westward swam she,

145
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,172
Swam to north-west and to south-west,

146
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:48,504
And around in all directions,

147
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,836
In the sharpness of her torment,

148
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:55,168
In her body's fearful anguish;

149
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,500
Yet no child was fashioned from her,

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,784
And no offspring was perfected.

151
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:05,068
Then she fell to weeping gently,

152
00:09:05,068 --> 00:09:08,352
And in words like these expressed her:

153
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:11,636
"O how wretched is my fortune,

154
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,920
Wandering thus, a child unhappy!

155
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,204
I have wandered far already,

156
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,488
And I dwell beneath the heaven,

157
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:24,772
By the tempest tossed for ever,

158
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,056
While the billows drive me onward.

159
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,340
O'er this wide expanse of water,

160
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,624
On the far-extending billows.

161
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:37,908
"Better were it had I tarried,

162
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:41,192
Virgin in aerial regions,

163
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,476
Then I should not drift for ever,

164
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:47,760
As the Mother of the Waters.

165
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,044
Here my life is cold and dreary,

166
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:54,328
Every moment now is painful,

167
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,612
Ever tossing on the billows,

168
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:00,896
Ever floating on the water.

169
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:04,180
"Ukko, thou of Gods the highest,

170
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,464
Ruler of the whole of heaven,

171
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:10,748
Hasten here, for thou art needed;

172
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:14,032
Hasten here at my entreaty.

173
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:17,316
Free the damsel from her burden,

174
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,600
And release her from her tortures.

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,880
Quickly haste, and yet more quickly,

176
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,160
Where I long for thee so sorely."

177
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,440
Short the time that passed thereafter,

178
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,720
Scarce a moment had passed over,

179
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,000
Ere a beauteous teal came flying

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,280
Lightly hovering o'er the water,

181
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,560
Seeking for a spot to rest in,

182
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,840
Searching for a home to dwell in.

183
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,120
Eastward flew she, westward flew she.

184
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,400
Flew to north-west and to southward,

185
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,680
But the place she sought she found not,

186
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,960
Not a spot, however barren,

187
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,240
Where her nest she could establish,

188
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,520
Or a resting-place could light on.

189
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,800
Then she hovered, slowly moving,

190
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,080
And she pondered and reflected,

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,360
"If my nest in wind I 'stablish

192
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,640
Or should rest it on the billows,

193
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,920
Then the winds will overturn it,

194
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,200
Or the waves will drift it from me."

195
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,480
Then the Mother of the Waters,

196
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,760
Water-Mother, maid aerial,

197
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,040
From the waves her knee uplifted,

198
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,320
Raised her shoulder from the billows,

199
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,600
That the teal her nest might 'stablish,

200
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,844
And might find a peaceful dwelling.

201
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:49,088
Then the teal, the bird so beauteous,

202
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:52,332
Hovered slow, and gazed around her,

203
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:55,576
And she saw the knee uplifted

204
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:58,820
From the blue waves of the ocean,

205
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,064
And she thought she saw a hillock,

206
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:05,308
Freshly green with springing verdure.

207
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,552
There she flew, and hovered slowly,

208
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:11,796
Gently on the knee alighting,

209
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:15,040
And her nest she there established,

210
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,284
And she laid her eggs all golden,

211
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:21,528
Six gold eggs she laid within it,

212
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:24,772
And a seventh she laid of iron.

213
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:28,016
O'er her eggs the teal sat brooding,

214
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:31,260
And the knee grew warm beneath her;

215
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,504
And she sat one day, a second,

216
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,748
Brooded also on the third day;

217
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:40,992
Then the Mother of the Waters,

218
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:44,236
Water-Mother, maid aerial,

219
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:47,480
Felt it hot, and felt it hotter,

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,724
And she felt her skin was heated,

221
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,968
Till she thought her knee was burning,

222
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:57,212
And that all her veins were melting.

223
00:12:57,212 --> 00:13:00,456
Then she jerked her knee with quickness,

224
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,700
And her limbs convulsive shaking,

225
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,924
Rolled the eggs into the water,

226
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:10,148
Down amid the waves of ocean,

227
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:13,372
And to splinters they were broken,

228
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,596
And to fragments they were shattered.

229
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,820
In the ooze they were not wasted,

230
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,044
Nor the fragments in the water,

231
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:26,268
But a wondrous change came o'er them,

232
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:29,492
And the fragments all grew lovely.

233
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:32,716
From the cracked egg's lower fragment,

234
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:35,940
Now the solid earth was fashioned,

235
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,164
From the cracked egg's upper fragment,

236
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:42,388
Rose the lofty arch of heaven,

237
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,612
From the yolk, the upper portion,

238
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:48,836
Now became the sun's bright lustre;

239
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:52,060
From the white, the upper portion,

240
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,284
Rose the moon that shines so brightly;

241
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:58,508
Whatso in the egg was mottled,

242
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:01,732
Now became the stars in heaven,

243
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:04,956
Whatso in the egg was blackish,

244
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:08,180
In the air as cloudlets floated.

245
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,404
Now the time passed quickly over,

246
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,628
And the years rolled quickly onward,

247
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:17,852
In the new sun's shining lustre,

248
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:21,076
In the new moon's softer beaming.

249
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:24,300
Still the Water-Mother floated,

250
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,532
Water-Mother, maid aerial,

251
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:30,764
Ever on the peaceful waters,

252
00:14:30,764 --> 00:14:33,996
On the billows' foamy surface,

253
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:37,228
With the moving waves before her,

254
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:40,460
And the heaven serene behind her.

255
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,692
When the ninth year had passed over,

256
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,924
And the summer tenth was passing,

257
00:14:46,924 --> 00:14:50,156
From the sea her head she lifted,

258
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,388
And her forehead she uplifted,

259
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:56,620
And she then began Creation,

260
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,852
And she brought the world to order,

261
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:03,084
On the open ocean's surface,

262
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,316
On the far extending waters.

263
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:09,548
Wheresoe'er her hand she pointed,

264
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:12,780
There she formed the jutting headlands;

265
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,012
Wheresoe'er her feet she rested,

266
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:19,244
There she formed the caves for fishes;

267
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:22,476
When she dived beneath the water,

268
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:25,708
There she formed the depths of ocean;

269
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,940
When towards the land she turned her,

270
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,172
There the level shores extended,

271
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,404
Where her feet to land extended,

272
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:38,636
Spots were formed for salmon-netting;

273
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,868
Where her head the land touched lightly,

274
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:45,100
There the curving bays extended.

275
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,312
Further from the land she floated,

276
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:51,524
And abode in open water,

277
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,736
And created rocks in ocean,

278
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,948
And the reefs that eyes behold not,

279
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:01,160
Where the ships are often shattered,

280
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,372
And the sailors' lives are ended.

281
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:07,584
Now the isles were formed already,

282
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,796
In the sea the rocks were planted;

283
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:14,008
Pillars of the sky established,

284
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:17,220
Lands and continents created;

285
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,432
Rocks engraved as though with figures,

286
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:23,644
And the hills were cleft with fissures.

287
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,856
Still unborn was Väinämöinen;

288
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:30,068
Still unborn, the bard immortal.

289
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:33,280
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

290
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,492
Rested in his mother's body

291
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:39,704
For the space of thirty summers,

292
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,916
And the sum of thirty winters,

293
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,128
Ever on the placid waters,

294
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:49,340
And upon the foaming billows.

295
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,552
So he pondered and reflected

296
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,764
How he could continue living

297
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,976
In a resting-place so gloomy,

298
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,188
In a dwelling far too narrow,

299
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,400
Where he could not see the moonlight,

300
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,612
Neither could behold the sunlight.

301
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,824
Then he spake the words which follow,

302
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:15,036
And expressed his thoughts in this wise:

303
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:18,248
"Aid me Moon, and Sun release me,

304
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:21,460
And the Great Bear lend his counsel,

305
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,672
Through the portal that I know not,

306
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:27,884
Through the unaccustomed passage.

307
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:31,096
From the little nest that holds me,

308
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:34,308
From a dwelling-place so narrow,

309
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,520
To the land conduct the roamer,

310
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,732
To the open air conduct me,

311
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,944
To behold the moon in heaven,

312
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:47,156
And the splendour of the sunlight;

313
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:50,368
See the Great Bear's stars above me,

314
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:53,580
And the shining stars in heaven."

315
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,792
When the moon no freedom gave him,

316
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:00,004
Neither did the sun release him,

317
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:03,216
Then he wearied of existence,

318
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,428
And his life became a burden.

319
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:09,640
Thereupon he moved the portal,

320
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,852
With his finger, fourth in number,

321
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:16,064
Opened quick the bony gateway,

322
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:19,276
With the toes upon his left foot,

323
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:22,488
With his nails beyond the threshold,

324
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:25,700
With his knees beyond the gateway.

325
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,915
Headlong in the water falling,

326
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:32,130
With his hands the waves repelling,

327
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,345
Thus the man remained in ocean,

328
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:38,560
And the hero on the billows.

329
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,775
In the sea five years he sojourned,

330
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,990
Waited five years, waited six years,

331
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,205
Seven years also, even eight years,

332
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:51,420
On the surface of the ocean,

333
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,635
By a nameless promontory,

334
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,850
Near a barren, treeless country.

335
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,065
On the land his knees he planted,

336
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:04,280
And upon his arms he rested,

337
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,495
Rose that he might view the moonbeams,

338
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:10,710
And enjoy the pleasant sunlight,

339
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,925
See the Great Bear's stars above him,

340
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:17,140
And the shining stars in heaven.

341
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,355
Thus was ancient Väinämöinen,

342
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:23,570
He, the ever famous minstrel,

343
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,785
Born of the divine Creatrix,

344
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:30,000
Born of Ilmatar, his mother.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Born of the divine Creatrix,

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Born of Ilmatar, his mother.
