1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,075
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

2
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:39,650
Swam upon the open ocean,

3
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,225
Drifting like a fallen pine-tree,

4
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:46,800
Like a rotten branch of fir-tree,

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,375
During six days of the summer,

6
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,950
And for six nights in succession,

7
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,525
While the sea spread wide before him,

8
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:01,100
And the sky was clear above him.

9
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,675
Thus he swam for two nights longer,

10
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:08,250
And for two days long and dreary.

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,825
When the ninth night darkened round him,

12
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:15,400
And the eighth day had passed over,

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,975
Sudden anguish came upon him,

14
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,550
And his pain grew ever greater.

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,125
From his toes his nails were dropping,

16
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,700
And the joints from off his fingers.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,275
Then the aged Väinämöinen

18
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,850
Spoke in words like those which follow:

19
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,425
"Woe to me, unhappy creature,

20
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:44,000
Overburdened with misfortune!

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,575
I have wandered from my country,

22
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:51,150
And my ancient home abandoned.

23
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,725
'Neath the open sky for ever,

24
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:58,300
Driven along in sun and moonlight,

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,796
Rocked about by winds for ever,

26
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:05,292
Tossed about by every billow,

27
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,788
On the wide expanse of water,

28
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,284
Out upon the open ocean,

29
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:15,780
Here I live a cold existence,

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,276
And 'tis painful thus to wallow,

31
00:02:19,276 --> 00:02:22,772
Always tossing on the billows,

32
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:26,268
On the surface of the waters.

33
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:29,764
"Now, alas, I know no longer

34
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:33,260
How to lead this life of sadness

35
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,756
In this everlasting trouble,

36
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,252
In an age when all is fleeting.

37
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:43,748
Shall I rear in wind a dwelling,

38
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,244
Build a house upon the waters?

39
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:50,740
"If I rear in wind a dwelling,

40
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,236
Then the wind would not sustain it;

41
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,732
If I build a house on water,

42
00:02:57,732 --> 00:03:01,228
Then the waves will drift it from me."

43
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:04,724
Came a bird from Lapland flying,

44
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,220
From the north-east came an eagle,

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,716
Not the largest of the eagles,

46
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:15,212
Nor was he among the smallest,

47
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,708
With one wing he swept the water,

48
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:22,204
To the sky was swung the other;

49
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:25,700
On the sea his tail he rested,

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,164
On the cliffs his beak he rattled.

51
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:32,628
Slowly back and forwards flying,

52
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,092
Turning all around, and gazing,

53
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,556
Soon he saw old Väinämöinen

54
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:43,020
On the blue waves of the ocean.

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,484
"What has brought you here, O hero,

56
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:49,948
Wandering through the waves of ocean?"

57
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:53,412
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

58
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:56,876
Answered in the words which follow:

59
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:00,340
"This has brought the man to ocean,

60
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,804
Plunged the hero in the sea-waves.

61
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:07,268
I would seek the maid of Pohja,

62
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:10,732
Woo the maiden of Pimentola.

63
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:14,196
"On my journey swift I hasted,

64
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:17,660
On the ocean's watery surface,

65
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,124
Till about the time of daybreak,

66
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:24,588
Came I, after many mornings,

67
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:28,052
Where is Luotola's deep embayment,

68
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:31,516
Hard by Joukola's rapid river,

69
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:34,980
When my horse was shot beneath me,

70
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,444
By an arrow launched against me.

71
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,908
"Thus I fell into the water,

72
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:45,372
In the waves I plunged my fingers,

73
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:48,836
And the wind impels me onward,

74
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:52,300
And the billows drift me forward.

75
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,732
"Then there came a gale from north-west,

76
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:59,164
From the east a mighty tempest,

77
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:02,596
Far away the tempest drove me,

78
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:06,028
Swimming from the land still further,

79
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:09,460
Many days have I been floating,

80
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,892
Many days have I been swimming,

81
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:16,324
On this wide expanse of water,

82
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:19,756
Out upon the open ocean.

83
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:23,188
And I cannot now conjecture,

84
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:26,620
Cannot guess, nor e'en imagine,

85
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,052
How I finally shall perish,

86
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,484
And what death shall overtake me

87
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:36,916
Whether I shall die of hunger,

88
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,348
Or shall sink beneath the waters."

89
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:43,780
Said the bird of air, the eagle,

90
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,212
"Let thy heart be free from trouble;

91
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,644
Climb upon my back, and seat thee,

92
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:54,076
Standing up upon my wing-tips,

93
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,508
From the sea will I transport thee,

94
00:05:57,508 --> 00:06:00,940
Wheresoever thou may'st fancy.

95
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,372
For the day I well remember,

96
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:07,804
And recall a happier season,

97
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:11,236
When fell Kaleva's green forest,

98
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:14,668
Cleared was Osmola's famed island,

99
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,100
But thou didst protect the birch-tree,

100
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,512
And the beauteous tree left'st standing,

101
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:24,924
That the birds might rest upon it,

102
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:28,336
And that I myself might sit there."

103
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:31,748
Then the aged Väinämöinen

104
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:35,160
Raised his head from out the water,

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,572
From the sea the man sprang upward,

106
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:41,984
From the waves the hero mounted.

107
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,396
On the eagle's wings he sat him,

108
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,808
On the wing-tips of the eagle.

109
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,220
Then the bird of air, the eagle,

110
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,632
Raised the aged Väinämöinen,

111
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:59,044
Through the path of wind he bore him,

112
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,456
And along the east-wind's pathway,

113
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,868
To the utmost bounds of Pohja,

114
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:09,280
Onwards to the misty Sariola,

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,692
There abandoned Väinämöinen,

116
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:16,104
Soared into the air, and left him.

117
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:19,516
There stood Väinämöinen weeping,

118
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:22,928
There stood weeping and lamenting,

119
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,340
On the borders of the ocean,

120
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,752
On a land whose name he knew not,

121
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:33,164
With a hundred wounds upon him,

122
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:36,576
By a thousand winds belaboured,

123
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,988
And his beard was much disordered,

124
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:43,400
And his hair was all entangled.

125
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,812
Thus he wept for two, and three nights,

126
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:50,224
For as many days stood weeping,

127
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:53,636
For the country round he knew not,

128
00:07:53,636 --> 00:07:57,048
And no path could he discover,

129
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:00,460
Which perchance might lead him homeward,

130
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,872
Back to a familiar country,

131
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:07,284
To his own, his native country,

132
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:10,696
Where he passed his days aforetime.

133
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:14,108
But the little maid of Pohja,

134
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:17,520
Fair-haired damsel of the household,

135
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,932
With the sun had made agreement,

136
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:24,344
And both sun and moon had promised,

137
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:27,756
They would always rise together,

138
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:31,168
And they would awake together.

139
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:34,580
She herself arose before them,

140
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,992
Ere the sun or moon had risen,

141
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:41,404
Long before the time of cockcrow,

142
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:44,816
Or the chirping of a chicken.

143
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,228
From five sheep she shore the fleeces,

144
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,640
Clipped the wool from off six lambkins,

145
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,052
In her loom she wove the fleeces,

146
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:58,464
And the whole with care she carded,

147
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:01,876
Long before the dawn of morning,

148
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,288
Long before the sun had risen.

149
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:08,700
After this she washed the tables,

150
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,080
Swept the wide-extended flooring,

151
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,460
With the broom of twigs all leafless,

152
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,840
Then with broom of leafy branches.

153
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,220
Then the sweepings she collected

154
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,600
In the dustpan made of copper;

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,980
Out of doors she took the rubbish,

156
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,360
To the field beyond the farmyard,

157
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,740
To the field's extremest limit,

158
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,120
Where the lowest fence has opening.

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,500
There she stood upon the sweepings,

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,880
And she turned around, and listened.

161
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,260
From the lake she heard a weeping,

162
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,640
Sounds of woe across the river.

163
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,020
Quickly then she hastened homeward,

164
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,400
And she hurried to the parlour.

165
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,780
As she came, she told her tidings,

166
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,160
In such words as those which follow:

167
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,540
"From the lake I hear a weeping,

168
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,920
Sounds of woe across the river."

169
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,300
Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,

170
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,680
Old and gap-toothed dame of Pohja,

171
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,060
Hastened forth into the farmyard,

172
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,440
Hurried to the fence's opening,

173
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,820
Where she bent her ear to listen,

174
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,200
And she spoke the words which follow:

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,584
"This is not like childhood's weeping

176
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:39,968
Nor like women's lamentation,

177
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:43,352
But a bearded hero weeping;

178
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,736
Thus weep men whose chins are bearded."

179
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:50,120
Three planks high, the boat was builded,

180
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,504
Which she pushed into the water,

181
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:56,888
And herself began to row it,

182
00:10:56,888 --> 00:11:00,272
And she rowed, and hastened onward

183
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:03,656
To the spot where Väinämöinen,

184
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:07,040
Where the hero was lamenting.

185
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,424
There was Väinämöinen weeping,

186
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:13,808
There Uvanto's swain lamented,

187
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:17,192
By the dreary clumps of willow,

188
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:20,576
By the tangled hedge of cherry.

189
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:23,960
Moved his mouth, his beard was shaking,

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,344
But his lips he did not open.

191
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,728
Then did Pohjola's old Mistress,

192
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:34,112
Speak unto, and thus addressed him:

193
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:37,496
"O thou aged man unhappy,

194
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,880
Thou art in a foreign country!"

195
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,264
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

196
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:47,648
Lifted up his head and answered

197
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:51,032
In the very words that follow:

198
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:54,416
"True it is, and well I know it,

199
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,800
I am in a foreign country,

200
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,204
Absolutely unfamiliar.

201
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:04,608
I was better in my country,

202
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:08,012
Greater in the home I came from."

203
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:11,416
Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,224
"In the first place you must tell me,

206
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:21,628
If I may make bold to ask you,

From what race you take your lineage,

208
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:28,436
And from what heroic nation?"

"Well my name was known aforetime,

212
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:42,052
And in former days was famous,

213

Ever cheerful in the evening,

214
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:48,860
Ever singing in the valleys,

215
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,264
There in Väinölä's sweet meadows,

216
00:12:52,264 --> 00:12:55,668
And on Kalevala's broad heathlands;

217
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:59,072
But my grief is now so heavy

218
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:02,476
That I know myself no longer."

219
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:05,880
Louhi, Pohjola's old Mistress,

00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:12,688
"Rise, O man, from out the marshes,

Hero, seek another pathway.

223
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:19,496
Tell me now of thy misfortunes,

224
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:22,900
And relate me thy adventure."

225
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,312
Thus she made him cease his weeping,

226
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:29,724
Made the hero cease lamenting;

227
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:33,136
And into her boat she took him,

228
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:36,548
Bade him at the stern be seated,

229
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,960
And herself resumed the oars,

230
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,372
And she then began to row him

231
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:46,784
Unto Pohjola, o'er water,

232
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,196
And she brought him to her dwelling.

233
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,608
Then she fed the famished stranger,

234
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:57,020
And she dried his dripping garments,

235
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,432
Then she rubbed his limbs all stiffened,

236
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:03,844
And she warmed him and shampooed him,

237
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,256
Till she had restored his vigour,

238
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,668
And the hero had recovered.

239
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:14,080
After this, she spoke and asked him,

240
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,492
In the very words which follow:

241
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:20,904
"Why did'st weep, O Väinämöinen,

Why lament, Uvantolainen,

In that miserable region,

244
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:31,140
On the borders of the lakelet?"

Tossed about upon the billows,

On the wide expanse of water,

252
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:58,316

That I swam beyond my country,

256
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:11,804
Left the country so familiar,

All the trees around me pain me,

All the pine-twigs seem to pierce me,

Every birch-tree seems to flog me,

262
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:32,036
Every alder seems to wound me,

263
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:35,408
But the wind is friendly to me,

264
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:38,780
And the sun still shines upon me,

265
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,152
In this unaccustomed country,

266
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:45,524

00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:20,405
Noisily upon the journey,

367
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,753
Forth from Pohjola's dark regions,

368
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:27,100
Sariola for ever misty.

369
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,600
Forth from Pohjola's dark regions,

370
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,000
Sariola for ever misty.
