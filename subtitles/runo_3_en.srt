1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,667
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast

2
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,333
Passed the days of his existence

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,000
Where lie Väinölä's sweet meadows,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,667
Kalevala's extended heathlands:

5
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,333
There he sang his songs of sweetness

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,000
Sang his songs and proved his wisdom.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,667
Day by day he sang unwearied,

8
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,333
Night by night discoursed unceasing,

9
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,000
Sang the songs of by-gone ages,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,667
Hidden words of ancient wisdom,

11
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:54,333
Songs which all the children sing not.

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,000
All beyond men's comprehension,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,667
In these ages of misfortune,

14
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:05,333
When the race is near Its ending.

15
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,000
Far away the news was carried,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,667
Far abroad was spread the tidings

17
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:16,333
Of the songs of Väinämöinen,

18
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,000
Of the wisdom of the hero;

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,667
In the south was spread the rumour;

20
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,333
Reached to Pohjola the tidings.

21
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:31,000
Here dwelt youthful Joukahainen,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,667
He, the meagre youth of Lapland;

23
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,333
And, when visiting the village,

24
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,000
Wondrous tales he heard related,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
How there dwelt another minstrel,

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
And that better songs were carolled.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
Far in Väinölä's sweet meadows,

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,080
Kalevala's extended heathlands;

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,600
Better songs than he could compass;

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,120
Better than his father taught him.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,640
This he heard with great displeasure,

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
And his heart was filled with envy

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,680
That the songs of Väinämöinen

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
Better than his own were reckoned.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
Then he went to seek his mother;

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,240
Sought her out, the aged woman,

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,760
And declared that he would journey,

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
And was eager to betake him,

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
Unto Väinölä's far dwellings,

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,320
That he might contend with Väinö.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,840
But his father straight forbade him.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
Both his father and his mother,

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Thence to Väinölä to journey,

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,400
That he might contend with Väinö.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
"He will surely sing against you,

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
Sing against you, and will ban you,

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,960
Sink your mouth and head in snow-drifts,

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,480
And your hands in bitter tempest:

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
Till your hands and feet are stiffened,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,480
And incapable of motion."

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,960
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,440
"Good the counsel of my father,

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,920
And my mother's counsel better;

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,400
Best of all my own opinion.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,880
I will set myself against him,

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,360
And defy him to a contest,

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,840
I myself my songs will sing him,

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,320
I myself will speak my mantras;

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,800
Sing until the best of minstrels

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Shall become the worst of singers.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,760
Shoes of stone will I provide him,

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,240
Wooden trousers on his haunches;

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,720
On his breast a stony burden,

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,200
And a rock upon his shoulders;

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,680
Stony gloves his hands shall cover.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,160
And his head a stony helmet."

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,640
Then he went his way unheeding,

68
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,120
Went his way, and fetched his gelding,

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,600
From whose mouth the fire was flashing,

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,080
'Neath whose legs the sparks were flying.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Then the fiery steed he harnessed,

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,040
To the golden sledge he yoked him,

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,520
In the sledge himself he mounted,

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,000
And upon the seat he sat him,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,440
O'er the horse his whip he brandished,

76
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,880
With the beaded whip he smote him,

77
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,320
From the place the horse sprang quickly,

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,760
And he darted lightly forwards.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,200
On he drove with thundering clatter,

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,640
As he drove a day, a second,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,080
Driving also on the third day,

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,520
And at length upon the third day,

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,960
Came to Väinölä's sweet meadows,

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,400
Kalevala's extended heathlands.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,840
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

86
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,280
He, the oldest of magicians,

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,720
As it chanced was driving onward,

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,160
Peacefully his course pursuing

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,600
On through Väinölä's sweet meadows,

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,040
Kalevala's extended heathlands.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,480
Came the youthful Joukahainen

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,920
Driving on the road against him,

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,360
And the shafts were wedged together,

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,800
And the reins were all entangled,

95
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,240
And the collar jammed with collar,

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,680
And the runners dashed together.

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,120
Thus their progress was arrested,

98
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Thus they halted and reflected;

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,000
Sweat dropped down upon the runners;

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,320
From the shafts the steam was rising.

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,640
Asked the aged Väinämöinen,

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,960
"Who are you, and what your lineage,

103
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,280
You who drive so reckless onward,

104
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,600
Utterly without reflection?

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,920
Broken are the horses' collars,

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,240
And the wooden runners likewise;

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,560
You have smashed my sledge to pieces.

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,880
Broke the sledge in which I travelled."

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,200
Then the youthful Joukahainen

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,520
Answered in the words which follow:

111
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,840
"I am youthful Joukahainen;

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,160
But yourself should also tell me,

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,480
What your race, and what your nation,

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,800
And from what vile stock you issue."

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,120
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,440
Told his name without concealment,

117
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,760
And began to speak as follows:

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,080
"Youth, if you are Joukahainen,

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,400
You should move aside a little.

120
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,720
For remember, you are younger."

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,040
But the youthful Joukahainen

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,360
Answered in the words which follow:

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,680
"Here of youthfulness we reck not;

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,000
Nought doth youth or age concern us,

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
He who highest stands in knowledge,

126
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,720
He whose wisdom is the greatest,

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
Let him keep the path before him,

128
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
And the other yield the passage.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,800
If you are old Väinämöinen,

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
And the oldest of the minstrels,

131
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,520
Let us give ourselves to singing,

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,880
Let us now repeat our sayings,

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,240
That the one may teach the other.

134
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,600
And the one surpass the other,"

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,960
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

136
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,320
Answered in the words which follow:

137
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,680
"What can I myself accomplish

138
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,040
As a wise man or a singer?

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,400
I have passed my life in quiet,

140
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,760
Here among these very moorlands,

141
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,120
On the borders of my home-field

142
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,480
I have heard the cuckoo calling.

143
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,840
But apart from this at present,

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,200
I will ask you to inform me

145
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,560
What may be your greatest wisdom;

146
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,920
And the utmost of your knowledge?"

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,280
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

148
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,640
"Many things I know in fulness,

149
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,000
And I know with perfect clearness,

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,240
And my insight shows me plainly,

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,480
In the roof we find the smoke-hole,

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,720
And the fire is near the hearthstone.

153
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,960
"Joyful life the seal is leading,

154
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,200
In the waves there sports the sea-dog,

155
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,440
And he feeds upon the salmon,

156
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,680
And the powans round about him.

157
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,920
"Smooth the water loved by powans,

158
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,160
Smooth the surface, too, for salmon;

159
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,400
And in frost the pike is spawning,

160
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,640
Slimy fish in wintry weather.

161
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,880
Sluggish is the perch, the humpback,

162
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,120
In the depths it swims in autumn,

163
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,360
But it spawns in drought of summer,

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,600
Swimming slowly to the margin.

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,840
"If this does not yet suffice you,

166
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,080
I am wise in other matters,

167
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,320
And of weighty things can tell you.

168
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,560
In the north they plough with reindeer,

169
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,800
In the south the mare is useful,

170
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,040
And the elk In furthest Lapland.

171
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,280
"Trees I know on Pisa mountain,

172
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,520
Firs upon the rocks of Horna,

173
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,760
Tall the trees on Pisa mountain,

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,000
And the firs on rocks of Horna.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,240
"Three great waterfalls I know of,

176
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,480
And as many lakes extensive,

177
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,720
And as many lofty mountains,

178
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,960
Underneath the vault of heaven.

179
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Halläpyörä is in Hame,

180
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,440
Karjala has Kaatrakoski,

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,680
But they do not match the Vuoksi,

182
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,920
There where Imatra is rushing."

183
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,160
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,400
"Childish tales, and woman's wisdom,

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,640
But for bearded men unsuited,

186
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,880
And for married men unfitted.

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,120
Tell me words of deepest wisdom.

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,360
Tell me now of things eternal."

189
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,600
Then the youthful Joukahainen

190
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,840
Answered in the words which follow:

191
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,080
"Well I know whence comes the titmouse,

192
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,320
That the titmouse is a birdie,

193
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,560
And a snake the hissing viper,

194
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,800
And the ruffe a fish in water.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,040
And I know that hard is iron,

196
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,280
And that mud when black is bitter.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,520
Painful, too, is boiling water,

198
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,760
And the heat of fire is hurtful,

199
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,000
Water is the oldest medicine,

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
Cataract's foam a magic potion;

201
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
The Creator's self a sorcerer,

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Jumala the Great Magician.

203
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
"From the rock springs forth the water,

204
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
And the fire from heaven descendeth,

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
And from ore we get the iron,

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,400
And in hills we find the copper.

207
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,600
"Marshy country is the oldest,

208
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
And the first of trees the willow.

209
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Pine-roots were the oldest houses,

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
And the earliest pots were stone ones."

211
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,400
Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

212
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,600
Answered in the words which follow:

213
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
"Is there more that you can tell me,

214
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Or is this the end of nonsense?"

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

216
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,400
"Many little things I wot of,

217
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,600
And the time I well remember

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
When 'twas I who ploughed the ocean,

219
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
Hollowed out the depths of ocean,

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
And I dug the caves for fishes,

221
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
And I sunk the deep abysses,

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,600
When the lakes I first created,

223
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
And I heaped the hills together.

224
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,000
And the rocky mountains fashioned.

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
"Then I stood with six great heroes!

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
I myself the seventh among them.

227
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,360
When the earth was first created,

228
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
And the air above expanded;

229
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
For the sky I fixed the pillars.

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
And I reared the arch of heaven,

231
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,840
To the moon assigned his journey,

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,960
Helped the sun upon his pathway,

233
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,080
To the Bear his place appointed,

234
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,200
And the stars in heaven I scattered,"

235
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,320
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

236
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
"Ay, indeed, a shameless liar!

237
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,560
You at least were never present

238
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
When the ocean first was furrowed,

239
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
And the ocean depths were hollowed.

240
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
And the caves were dug for fishes,

241
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
And the deep abysses sunken,

242
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
And the lakes were first created,

243
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,280
When the hills were heaped together,

244
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,400
And the rocky mountains fashioned.

245
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,520
"No one ever yet had seen you,

246
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,640
None had seen you, none had heard you.

247
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,760
When the earth was first created,

248
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
And the air above expanded,

249
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,000
When the posts of heaven were planted,

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,160
And the arch of heaven exalted,

251
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,320
When the moon was shown his pathway,

252
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,480
And the sun was taught to journey,

253
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,640
When the Bear was fixed in heaven,

254
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,800
And the stars in heaven were scattered."

255
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,960
But the youthful Joukahainen

256
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,120
Answered in the words which follow:

257
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,280
"If I fail in understanding,

258
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,440
I will seek it at the sword-point.

259
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,600
O thou aged Väinämöinen,

260
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,760
O thou very broad-mouthed minstrel,

261
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,920
Let us measure swords together,

262
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,080
Let the blade decide between us."

263
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,240
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

264
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,400
"I have little cause to fret me

265
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,560
Either for your sword or wisdom,

266
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,720
For your sword-point or your judgment.

267
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,880
But, apart from this at present,

268
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,040
I will draw no sword upon you,

269
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,200
So contemptible a fellow,

270
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,360
And so pitiful a weakling."

271
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,520
Then the youthful Joukahainen

272
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,680
Shook his head, his mouth drawn crooked,

273
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,840
And he tossed his locks of blackness.

274
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,000
And he spake the words which follow:

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,080
"He who shuns the sword's decision,

276
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,160
Nor betakes him to his sword-blade,

277
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,240
To a swine I soon will sing him,

278
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,320
To a snouted swine transform him.

279
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,400
Heroes I have thus o'erpowered,

280
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,480
Hither will I drive and thither.

281
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,560
And will pitch them on the dunghill,

282
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,640
Grunting in the cowshed corner."

283
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Angry then was Väinämöinen,

284
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,800
Filled with wrath and indignation,

285
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,880
And himself commenced his singing,

286
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,960
And to speak his words of wisdom.

287
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,040
But he sang no childish ditties,

288
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,120
Children's songs and women's jesting,

289
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,200
But a song for bearded heroes,

290
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,280
Such as all the children sing not,

291
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,360
Nor a half the boys can master,

292
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,440
Nor a third can lovers compass,

293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,520
In the days of dark misfortune,

294
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,600
When our life is near its ending.

295
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,680
Sang the aged Väinämöinen;

296
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,760
Lakes swelled up, and earth was shaken,

297
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,840
And the coppery mountains trembled.

298
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,920
And the mighty rocks resounded.

299
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,000
And the mountains clove asunder;

300
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,080
On the shore the stones were shivered.

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,160
Then he sang of Joukahainen,

302
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,240
Changed his runners into saplings,

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,320
And to willows changed the collar,

304
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,400
And the reins he turned to alder,

305
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,480
And he sang the sledge all gilded,

306
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,560
To the lake among the rushes,

307
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,640
And the whip, with beads embellished,

308
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,720
To a reed upon the water,

309
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,800
And the horse, with front white-spotted

310
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,880
To a stone beside the torrent.

311
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,960
Then he sang his sword, gold-hilted,

312
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,040
To a lightning-flash in heaven,

313
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,120
And his ornamented crossbow,

314
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,200
To a rainbow o'er the water,

315
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,280
And he sang his feathered arrows,

316
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,360
Into hawks that soar above him;

317
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,440
And his dog, with upturned muzzle,

318
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,520
Stands a stone in earth embedded.

319
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,600
From his head, his cap, by singing,

320
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,680
Next became a cloud above him,

321
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,760
From his hands, his gloves, by singing,

322
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,840
Next were changed to water-lilies,

323
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,920
And the blue coat he was wearing,

324
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Floats a fleecy cloud in heaven,

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,080
And the handsome belt that girt him,

326
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,160
In the sky as stars he scattered.

327
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,240
As he sang, sank Joukahainen

328
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,320
Waist-deep in the swamp beneath him,

329
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,400
Hip-deep in the marshy meadow,

330
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,480
To his arm-pits in a quicksand.

331
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,560
Then indeed young Joukahainen

332
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,640
Knew at last, and comprehended;

333
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,720
And he knew his course was finished,

334
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,800
And his journey now was ended.

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,880
For in singing he was beaten,

336
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,960
By the aged Väinämöinen.

337
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,040
He would raise his foot to struggle

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,120
But he could no longer lift it;

339
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,200
Then he tried to lift the other,

340
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,280
But as shod with stone he felt it.

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,360
Then the youthful Joukahainen

342
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,440
Felt the greatest pain and anguish,

343
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,520
And he fell in grievous trouble,

344
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,600
And he spoke the words which follow:

345
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,680
"O thou wisest Väinämöinen,

346
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,760
O thou oldest of magicians,

347
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,840
Speak thy words of magic backwards,

348
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,920
And reverse thy songs of magic.

349
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,000
Loose me from this place of terror,

350
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,040
And release me from my torment.

351
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,080
I will pay the highest ransom,

352
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,120
And the fixed reward will give thee."

353
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

354
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
"What do you propose to give me,

355
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,240
If I turn my words of magic,

356
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,280
And reverse my songs of magic,

357
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
Loose you from this place of terror,

358
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,360
And release you from your torment?"

359
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,400
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

360
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
"I've two crossbows I could give you,

361
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
Ay, a pair of splendid crossbows,

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,520
One shoots forth with passing quickness,

363
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,560
Surely hits the mark the other.

364
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,600
If it please you, choose between them."

365
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

366
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
"No, your bows I do not covet,

367
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,720
For the wretched bows I care not;

368
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
I myself have plenty of them.

369
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,800
All the walls are decked with crossbows,

370
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,840
All the pegs are hung with crossbows;

371
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
In the woods they wander hunting,

372
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,920
Nor a hero needs to span them."

373
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,960
Then the youthful Joukahainen

374
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,000
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,080
"I have yet two boats to offer;

377
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
Splendid boats, as I can witness,

378
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,160
One is light, and fit for racing,

379
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Heavy loads will bear the other;

380
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
If it please you, choose between them."

381
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

382
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,320
"No, your boats I do not covet,

383
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
And I will not choose between them,

384
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
I myself have plenty of them.

385
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
All the staves are full already,

386
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
Every creek is crowded with them,

387
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
Boats to face the gale adapted,

388
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,560
Boats against the wind that travel."

389
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,600
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

390
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,640
in the swamp he sang yet deeper.

391
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,680
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

392
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,720
"I have still two noble stallions;

393
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,760
Ay, a pair of handsome horses;

394
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,800
One of these of matchless swiftness,

395
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,840
And the other best in harness.

396
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,880
If it please you, choose between them."

397
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,920
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

398
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,960
"No, I do not want your horses;

399
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,000
Do not need your steeds, white-footed.

400
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I myself have plenty of them.

401
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Every stall has now its tenant,

402
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Every stable's filled with horses,

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
With their backs like water shining;

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Lakes of fat upon their haunches."

405
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
"O thou aged Väinämöinen,

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Speak thy words of magic backwards,

410
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And reverse thy songs of magic.

411
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I will give a golden helmet,

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And a hat filled up with silver,

413
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Which my father won in warfare,

414
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Which he won in battle-struggle."

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

416
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
"No, I do not want your silver,

417
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And for gold, I only scorn it.

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I myself have both in plenty.

419
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Every storeroom crammed with treasure.

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Every chest is overflowing.

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Gold as ancient as the moonlight,

422
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Silver with the sun coeval."

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

426
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
"O thou aged Väinämöinen,

427
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Loose me from this place of terror,

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And release me from my torment.

429
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
All my stacks at home I'll give thee,

430
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And my fields I likewise promise,

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
All to save my life I offer,

432
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If you will accept my ransom."

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Said the aged Väinämöinen,

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
"No, your barns I do not covet,

435
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And your fields are 'neath my notice,

436
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I myself have plenty of them.

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Fields are mine in all directions,

438
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Stocks are reared on every fallow,

439
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And my own fields please me better,

440
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And my stacks of corn are finest."

441
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen

442
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen,

444
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Felt at length the greatest anguish,

445
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Chin-deep in the swamp while sinking,

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
In the mud his beard was draggled,

447
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
In the moss his mouth was sunken,

448
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And his teeth among the tree-roots.

449
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
"O thou wisest Väinämöinen,

451
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
O thou oldest of magicians,

452
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Sing once more thy songs of magic,

453
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Grant the life of one so wretched,

454
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And release me from my prison.

455
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
In the stream my feet are sunken,

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
With the sand my eyes are smarting.

457
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
"Speak thy words of magic backwards,

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Break the spell that overwhelms me!

459
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You shall have my sister Aino,

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I will give my mother's daughter.

461
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
She shall dust your chamber for you,

462
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Sweep the flooring with her besom,

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Keep the milk-pots all in order;

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And shall wash your garments for you.

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Golden fabrics she shall weave you,

466
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And shall bake you cakes of honey."

467
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Then the aged Väinämöinen,

468
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Heard his words, and grew full joyful,

469
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Since to tend his age was promised

470
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Joukahainen's lovely sister.

471
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
On the stone of joy he sat him,

472
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
On the stone of song he rested,

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Sang an hour, and sang a second,

474
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And again he sang a third time:

475
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Thus reversed his words of magic,

476
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And dissolved the spell completely.

477
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen

478
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
From the mud his chin uplifted,

479
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And his beard he disentangled,

480
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
From the rock his steed led forward,

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Drew his sledge from out the bushes,

482
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
From the reeds his whip unloosing.

483
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Then upon his sledge he mounted,

484
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And upon the seat he sat him,

485
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And with gloomy thoughts he hastened,

486
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
With a heart all sad and doleful,

487
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Homeward to his dearest mother,

488
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Unto her, the aged woman.

489
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
On he drove with noise and tumult,

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Home he drove in consternation,

491
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And he broke the sledge to pieces,

492
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
At the door the shafts were broken.

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Then the noise alarmed his mother,

494
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And his father came and asked him,

495
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
"Recklessly the sledge was broken;

496
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Did you break the shafts on purpose?

497
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Wherefore do you drive so rashly,

498
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And arrive at home so madly?"

499
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Then the youthful Joukahainen

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
Could not keep his tears from flowing;

501
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,920
Sad he bowed his head in sorrow,

502
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,880
And his cap awry he shifted,

503
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
And his lips were dry and stiffened,

504
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,800
O'er his mouth his nose was drooping.

505
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
Then his mother came and asked him

506
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
Wherefore was he sunk in sorrow.

507
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,680
"O my son, why weep so sadly?

508
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,640
O my darling, why so troubled,

509
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,600
With thy lips so dry and stiffened,

510
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,560
O'er thy mouth thy nose thus drooping?"

511
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,520
Said the youthful Joukahainen,

512
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,480
"O my mother, who hast borne me,

513
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,440
There is cause for what has happened,

514
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,400
For the sorcerer has o'ercome me.

515
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,360
Cause enough have I for weeping,

516
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,320
And the sorcerer's brought me sorrow.

517
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,280
I myself must weep for ever,

518
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,240
And must pass my life in mourning,

519
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,200
For my very sister Aino,

520
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,160
She, my dearest mother's daughter,

521
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,120
I have pledged to Väinämöinen,

522
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
As the consort of the minstrel,

523
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,040
To support his feeble footsteps,

524
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,000
And to wait upon him always."

525
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,960
Joyous clapped her hands his mother,

526
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Both her hands she rubbed together,

527
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,880
And she spoke the words which follow:

528
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
"Do not weep, my son, my dearest,

529
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,800
For thy tears are quite uncalled for.

530
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,760
Little cause have we to sorrow,

531
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,720
For the hope I long have cherished.

532
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,680
All my lifetime I have wished it,

533
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,640
And have hoped this high-born hero

534
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,600
Might akin to us be reckoned,

535
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,560
And the minstrel Väinämöinen

536
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,520
Might become my daughter's husband."

537
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,480
But when Joukahainen's sister

538
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,440
Heard, she wept in deepest sorrow,

539
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,400
Wept one day, and wept a second,

540
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,360
At the threshold ever weeping,

541
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,320
Wept in overwhelming sorrow,

542
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,280
In the sadness of her spirit.

543
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,240
Then her mother said consoling,

544
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,200
"Wherefore weep, my little Aino?

545
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,160
You have gained a valiant bridegroom,

546
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,120
And the home of one most noble,

547
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,080
Where you'll look from out the window,

548
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,040
Sitting on the bench and talking."

549
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,000
But her daughter heard and answered,

550
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,968
"O my mother who hast borne me,

551
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,935
Therefore have I cause for weeping,

552
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,903
Weeping for the beauteous tresses,

553
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:31,871
Now my youthful head adorning,

554
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,839
And my hair so soft and glossy,

555
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,806
Which must now be wholly hidden,

556
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:40,774
While I still am young and blooming.

557
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:43,742
"Then must I through lifetime sorrow

558
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,710
For the splendour of the sunlight,

559
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,677
And the moonbeam's charming lustre

560
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:52,645
And the glory of the heavens,

561
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:55,613
Which I leave, while still so youthful,

562
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,581
And as child must quite abandon,

563
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:01,548
I must leave my brother's work-room,

564
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:04,516
Just beyond my father's window."

565
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:07,484
Said the mother to the daughter,

566
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:10,452
To the girl the crone made answer,

567
00:30:10,452 --> 00:30:13,419
"Cast away this foolish sorrow,

568
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,387
Cease your weeping, all uncalled for,

569
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:19,355
Little cause have you for sorrow,

570
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:22,323
Little cause for lamentation.

571
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,290
God's bright sun is ever shining

572
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,258
On the world in other regions,

573
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:31,226
Shines on other doors and windows

574
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,194
Than your father's or your brother's;

575
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:37,161
Berries grow on every mountain,

576
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:40,129
Strawberries on the plains are growing,

577
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,097
You can pluck them in your sorrow

578
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:46,065
Wheresoe'er your steps may lead you;

579
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:49,032
Not alone on father's acres,

580
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:52,000
Or upon your brother's clearings."

581
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Not alone on father's acres,

582
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Or upon your brother's clearings."
