1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,667
1 Väinämöinen, old and steadfast

2
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,333
2 Passed the days of his existence

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,000
3 Where lie Väinölä's sweet meadows,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,667
4 Kalevala's extended heathlands:

5
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:32,333
5 There he sang his songs of sweetness

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,000
6 Sang his songs and proved his wisdom.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,667
7 Day by day he sang unwearied,

8
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,333
8 Night by night discoursed unceasing,

9
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,000
9 Sang the songs of by-gone ages,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,667
10 Hidden words of ancient wisdom,

11
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:54,333
11 Songs which all the children sing not.

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,000
12 All beyond men's comprehension,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,667
13 In these ages of misfortune,

14
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:05,333
14 When the race is near Its ending.

15
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,000
15 Far away the news was carried,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,667
16 Far abroad was spread the tidings

17
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:16,333
17 Of the songs of Väinämöinen,

18
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,000
18 Of the wisdom of the hero;

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,667
19 In the south was spread the rumour;

20
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,333
20 Reached to Pohjola the tidings.

21
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:31,000
21 Here dwelt youthful Joukahainen,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,667
22 He, the meagre youth of Lapland;

23
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,333
23 And, when visiting the village,

24
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:42,000
24 Wondrous tales he heard related,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
25 How there dwelt another minstrel,

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
26 And that better songs were carolled.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
27 Far in Väinölä's sweet meadows,

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,080
28 Kalevala's extended heathlands;

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,600
29 Better songs than he could compass;

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,120
30 Better than his father taught him.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,640
31 This he heard with great displeasure,

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
32 And his heart was filled with envy

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,680
33 That the songs of Väinämöinen

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
34 Better than his own were reckoned.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
35 Then he went to seek his mother;

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,240
36 Sought her out, the aged woman,

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,760
37 And declared that he would journey,

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
38 And was eager to betake him,

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
39 Unto Väinölä's far dwellings,

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,320
40 That he might contend with Väinö.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,840
41 But his father straight forbade him.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
42 Both his father and his mother,

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,880
43 Thence to Väinölä to journey,

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,400
44 That he might contend with Väinö.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
45 "He will surely sing against you,

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
46 Sing against you, and will ban you,

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,960
47 Sink your mouth and head in snow-drifts,

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,480
48 And your hands in bitter tempest:

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
49 Till your hands and feet are stiffened,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,480
50 And incapable of motion."

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,960
51 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,440
52 "Good the counsel of my father,

53
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,920
53 And my mother's counsel better;

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,400
54 Best of all my own opinion.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,880
55 I will set myself against him,

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,360
56 And defy him to a contest,

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,840
57 I myself my songs will sing him,

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,320
58 I myself will speak my mantras;

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,800
59 Sing until the best of minstrels

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,280
60 Shall become the worst of singers.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,760
61 Shoes of stone will I provide him,

62
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,240
62 Wooden trousers on his haunches;

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,720
63 On his breast a stony burden,

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,200
64 And a rock upon his shoulders;

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,680
65 Stony gloves his hands shall cover.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,160
66 And his head a stony helmet."

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,640
67 Then he went his way unheeding,

68
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,120
68 Went his way, and fetched his gelding,

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,600
69 From whose mouth the fire was flashing,

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,080
70 'Neath whose legs the sparks were flying.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,560
71 Then the fiery steed he harnessed,

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,040
72 To the golden sledge he yoked him,

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,520
73 In the sledge himself he mounted,

74
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,000
74 And upon the seat he sat him,

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,440
75 O'er the horse his whip he brandished,

76
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,880
76 With the beaded whip he smote him,

77
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,320
77 From the place the horse sprang quickly,

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,760
78 And he darted lightly forwards.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,200
79 On he drove with thundering clatter,

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,640
80 As he drove a day, a second,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,080
81 Driving also on the third day,

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,520
82 And at length upon the third day,

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,960
83 Came to Väinölä's sweet meadows,

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,400
84 Kalevala's extended heathlands.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,840
85 Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

86
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,280
86 He, the oldest of magicians,

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,720
87 As it chanced was driving onward,

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,160
88 Peacefully his course pursuing

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,600
89 On through Väinölä's sweet meadows,

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,040
90 Kalevala's extended heathlands.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,480
91 Came the youthful Joukahainen

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,920
92 Driving on the road against him,

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,360
93 And the shafts were wedged together,

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,800
94 And the reins were all entangled,

95
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,240
95 And the collar jammed with collar,

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,680
96 And the runners dashed together.

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,120
97 Thus their progress was arrested,

98
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,560
98 Thus they halted and reflected;

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,000
99 Sweat dropped down upon the runners;

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,320
100 From the shafts the steam was rising.

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,640
101 Asked the aged Väinämöinen,

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,960
102 "Who are you, and what your lineage,

103
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,280
103 You who drive so reckless onward,

104
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,600
104 Utterly without reflection?

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,920
105 Broken are the horses' collars,

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,240
106 And the wooden runners likewise;

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,560
107 You have smashed my sledge to pieces.

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,880
108 Broke the sledge in which I travelled."

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,200
109 Then the youthful Joukahainen

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,520
110 Answered in the words which follow:

111
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,840
111 "I am youthful Joukahainen;

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,160
112 But yourself should also tell me,

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,480
113 What your race, and what your nation,

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,800
114 And from what vile stock you issue."

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,120
115 Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,440
116 Told his name without concealment,

117
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,760
117 And began to speak as follows:

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,080
118 "Youth, if you are Joukahainen,

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,400
119 You should move aside a little.

120
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,720
120 For remember, you are younger."

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,040
121 But the youthful Joukahainen

122
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,360
122 Answered in the words which follow:

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,680
123 "Here of youthfulness we reck not;

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,000
124 Nought doth youth or age concern us,

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,320
125 He who highest stands in knowledge,

126
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,640
126 He whose wisdom is the greatest,

127
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,960
127 Let him keep the path before him,

128
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,280
128 And the other yield the passage.

129
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,600
129 If you are old Väinämöinen,

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,920
130 And the oldest of the minstrels,

131
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,240
131 Let us give ourselves to singing,

132
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,560
132 Let us now repeat our sayings,

133
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,880
133 That the one may teach the other.

134
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,200
134 And the one surpass the other,"

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,520
135 Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

136
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,840
136 Answered in the words which follow:

137
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,160
137 "What can I myself accomplish

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,480
138 As a wise man or a singer?

139
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,800
139 I have passed my life in quiet,

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,120
140 Here among these very moorlands,

141
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,440
141 On the borders of my home-field

142
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,760
142 I have heard the cuckoo calling.

143
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,080
143 But apart from this at present,

144
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,400
144 I will ask you to inform me

145
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,720
145 What may be your greatest wisdom;

146
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,040
146 And the utmost of your knowledge?"

147
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,360
147 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

148
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,680
148 "Many things I know in fulness,

149
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,000
149 And I know with perfect clearness,

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,280
150 And my insight shows me plainly,

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,560
151 In the roof we find the smoke-hole,

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,840
152 And the fire is near the hearthstone.

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,120
153 "Joyful life the seal is leading,

154
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,400
154 In the waves there sports the sea-dog,

155
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,680
155 And he feeds upon the salmon,

156
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,960
156 And the powans round about him.

157
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,240
157 "Smooth the water loved by powans,

158
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,520
158 Smooth the surface, too, for salmon;

159
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,800
159 And in frost the pike is spawning,

160
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,080
160 Slimy fish in wintry weather.

161
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,360
161 Sluggish is the perch, the humpback,

162
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,640
162 In the depths it swims in autumn,

163
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,920
163 But it spawns in drought of summer,

164
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,200
164 Swimming slowly to the margin.

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,480
165 "If this does not yet suffice you,

166
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,760
166 I am wise in other matters,

167
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,040
167 And of weighty things can tell you.

168
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,320
168 In the north they plough with reindeer,

169
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,600
169 In the south the mare is useful,

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,880
170 And the elk In furthest Lapland.

171
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,160
171 "Trees I know on Pisa mountain,

172
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,440
172 Firs upon the rocks of Horna,

173
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,720
173 Tall the trees on Pisa mountain,

174
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,000
174 And the firs on rocks of Horna.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,240
175 "Three great waterfalls I know of,

176
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,480
176 And as many lakes extensive,

177
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,720
177 And as many lofty mountains,

178
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,960
178 Underneath the vault of heaven.

179
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,200
179 Halläpyörä is in Hame,

180
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,440
180 Karjala has Kaatrakoski,

181
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,680
181 But they do not match the Vuoksi,

182
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,920
182 There where Imatra is rushing."

183
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,160
183 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,400
184 "Childish tales, and woman's wisdom,

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,640
185 But for bearded men unsuited,

186
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,880
186 And for married men unfitted.

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,120
187 Tell me words of deepest wisdom.

188
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,360
188 Tell me now of things eternal."

189
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,600
189 Then the youthful Joukahainen

190
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,840
190 Answered in the words which follow:

191
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,080
191 "Well I know whence comes the titmouse,

192
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,320
192 That the titmouse is a birdie,

193
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,560
193 And a snake the hissing viper,

194
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,800
194 And the ruffe a fish in water.

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,040
195 And I know that hard is iron,

196
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,280
196 And that mud when black is bitter.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,520
197 Painful, too, is boiling water,

198
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,760
198 And the heat of fire is hurtful,

199
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,000
199 Water is the oldest medicine,

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
200 Cataract's foam a magic potion;

201
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
201 The Creator's self a sorcerer,

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,600
202 Jumala the Great Magician.

203
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
203 "From the rock springs forth the water,

204
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
204 And the fire from heaven descendeth,

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,200
205 And from ore we get the iron,

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,400
206 And in hills we find the copper.

207
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,600
207 "Marshy country is the oldest,

208
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
208 And the first of trees the willow.

209
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,000
209 Pine-roots were the oldest houses,

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
210 And the earliest pots were stone ones."

211
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,400
211 Väinämöinen, old and steadfast,

212
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,600
212 Answered in the words which follow:

213
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
213 "Is there more that you can tell me,

214
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
214 Or is this the end of nonsense?"

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
215 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

216
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,400
216 "Many little things I wot of,

217
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,600
217 And the time I well remember

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
218 When 'twas I who ploughed the ocean,

219
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
219 Hollowed out the depths of ocean,

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
220 And I dug the caves for fishes,

221
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
221 And I sunk the deep abysses,

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,600
222 When the lakes I first created,

223
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
223 And I heaped the hills together.

224
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,000
224 And the rocky mountains fashioned.

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
225 "Then I stood with six great heroes!

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
226 I myself the seventh among them.

227
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,360
227 When the earth was first created,

228
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
228 And the air above expanded;

229
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
229 For the sky I fixed the pillars.

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
230 And I reared the arch of heaven,

231
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,840
231 To the moon assigned his journey,

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,960
232 Helped the sun upon his pathway,

233
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,080
233 To the Bear his place appointed,

234
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,200
234 And the stars in heaven I scattered,"

235
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,320
235 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

236
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
236 "Ay, indeed, a shameless liar!

237
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,560
237 You at least were never present

238
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
238 When the ocean first was furrowed,

239
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
239 And the ocean depths were hollowed.

240
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
240 And the caves were dug for fishes,

241
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
241 And the deep abysses sunken,

242
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
242 And the lakes were first created,

243
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,280
243 When the hills were heaped together,

244
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,400
244 And the rocky mountains fashioned.

245
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,520
245 "No one ever yet had seen you,

246
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,640
246 None had seen you, none had heard you.

247
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,760
247 When the earth was first created,

248
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
248 And the air above expanded,

249
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,000
249 When the posts of heaven were planted,

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,120
250 And the arch of heaven exalted,

251
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
251 When the moon was shown his pathway,

252
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
252 And the sun was taught to journey,

253
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
253 When the Bear was fixed in heaven,

254
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
254 And the stars in heaven were scattered."

255
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
255 But the youthful Joukahainen

256
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,840
256 Answered in the words which follow:

257
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,960
257 "If I fail in understanding,

258
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,080
258 I will seek it at the sword-point.

259
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,200
259 O thou aged Väinämöinen,

260
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,320
260 O thou very broad-mouthed minstrel,

261
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
261 Let us measure swords together,

262
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,560
262 Let the blade decide between us."

263
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
263 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

264
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,800
264 "I have little cause to fret me

265
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,920
265 Either for your sword or wisdom,

266
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
266 For your sword-point or your judgment.

267
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
267 But, apart from this at present,

268
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,280
268 I will draw no sword upon you,

269
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,400
269 So contemptible a fellow,

270
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,520
270 And so pitiful a weakling."

271
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,640
271 Then the youthful Joukahainen

272
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,760
272 Shook his head, his mouth drawn crooked,

273
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,880
273 And he tossed his locks of blackness.

274
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,000
274 And he spake the words which follow:

275
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
275 "He who shuns the sword's decision,

276
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,240
276 Nor betakes him to his sword-blade,

277
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
277 To a swine I soon will sing him,

278
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
278 To a snouted swine transform him.

279
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
279 Heroes I have thus o'erpowered,

280
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,720
280 Hither will I drive and thither.

281
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,840
281 And will pitch them on the dunghill,

282
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,960
282 Grunting in the cowshed corner."

283
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,080
283 Angry then was Väinämöinen,

284
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,200
284 Filled with wrath and indignation,

285
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,320
285 And himself commenced his singing,

286
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
286 And to speak his words of wisdom.

287
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
287 But he sang no childish ditties,

288
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
288 Children's songs and women's jesting,

289
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
289 But a song for bearded heroes,

290
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
290 Such as all the children sing not,

291
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,040
291 Nor a half the boys can master,

292
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,160
292 Nor a third can lovers compass,

293
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,280
293 In the days of dark misfortune,

294
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,400
294 When our life is near its ending.

295
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,520
295 Sang the aged Väinämöinen;

296
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,640
296 Lakes swelled up, and earth was shaken,

297
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,760
297 And the coppery mountains trembled.

298
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,880
298 And the mighty rocks resounded.

299
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
299 And the mountains clove asunder;

300
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,080
300 On the shore the stones were shivered.

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,160
301 Then he sang of Joukahainen,

302
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,240
302 Changed his runners into saplings,

303
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,320
303 And to willows changed the collar,

304
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,400
304 And the reins he turned to alder,

305
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,480
305 And he sang the sledge all gilded,

306
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,560
306 To the lake among the rushes,

307
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,640
307 And the whip, with beads embellished,

308
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,720
308 To a reed upon the water,

309
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,800
309 And the horse, with front white-spotted

310
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,880
310 To a stone beside the torrent.

311
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,960
311 Then he sang his sword, gold-hilted,

312
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,040
312 To a lightning-flash in heaven,

313
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,120
313 And his ornamented crossbow,

314
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,200
314 To a rainbow o'er the water,

315
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,280
315 And he sang his feathered arrows,

316
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,360
316 Into hawks that soar above him;

317
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,440
317 And his dog, with upturned muzzle,

318
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,520
318 Stands a stone in earth embedded.

319
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,600
319 From his head, his cap, by singing,

320
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,680
320 Next became a cloud above him,

321
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,760
321 From his hands, his gloves, by singing,

322
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,840
322 Next were changed to water-lilies,

323
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,920
323 And the blue coat he was wearing,

324
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,000
324 Floats a fleecy cloud in heaven,

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,080
325 And the handsome belt that girt him,

326
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,160
326 In the sky as stars he scattered.

327
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,240
327 As he sang, sank Joukahainen

328
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,320
328 Waist-deep in the swamp beneath him,

329
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,400
329 Hip-deep in the marshy meadow,

330
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,480
330 To his arm-pits in a quicksand.

331
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,560
331 Then indeed young Joukahainen

332
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,640
332 Knew at last, and comprehended;

333
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,720
333 And he knew his course was finished,

334
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,800
334 And his journey now was ended.

335
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,880
335 For in singing he was beaten,

336
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,960
336 By the aged Väinämöinen.

337
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,040
337 He would raise his foot to struggle

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,120
338 But he could no longer lift it;

339
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,200
339 Then he tried to lift the other,

340
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,280
340 But as shod with stone he felt it.

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,360
341 Then the youthful Joukahainen

342
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,440
342 Felt the greatest pain and anguish,

343
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,520
343 And he fell in grievous trouble,

344
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,600
344 And he spoke the words which follow:

345
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,680
345 "O thou wisest Väinämöinen,

346
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,760
346 O thou oldest of magicians,

347
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,840
347 Speak thy words of magic backwards,

348
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,920
348 And reverse thy songs of magic.

349
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,000
349 Loose me from this place of terror,

350
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,040
350 And release me from my torment.

351
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,080
351 I will pay the highest ransom,

352
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,120
352 And the fixed reward will give thee."

353
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
353 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

354
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
354 "What do you propose to give me,

355
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,240
355 If I turn my words of magic,

356
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,280
356 And reverse my songs of magic,

357
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
357 Loose you from this place of terror,

358
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,360
358 And release you from your torment?"

359
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,400
359 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

360
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
360 "I've two crossbows I could give you,

361
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,480
361 Ay, a pair of splendid crossbows,

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,520
362 One shoots forth with passing quickness,

363
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,560
363 Surely hits the mark the other.

364
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,600
364 If it please you, choose between them."

365
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
365 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

366
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,680
366 "No, your bows I do not covet,

367
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,720
367 For the wretched bows I care not;

368
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
368 I myself have plenty of them.

369
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,800
369 All the walls are decked with crossbows,

370
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,840
370 All the pegs are hung with crossbows;

371
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,880
371 In the woods they wander hunting,

372
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,920
372 Nor a hero needs to span them."

373
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,960
373 Then the youthful Joukahainen

374
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,000
374 In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,040
375 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,080
376 "I have yet two boats to offer;

377
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
377 Splendid boats, as I can witness,

378
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,160
378 One is light, and fit for racing,

379
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,200
379 Heavy loads will bear the other;

380
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
380 If it please you, choose between them."

381
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
381 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

382
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,320
382 "No, your boats I do not covet,

383
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
383 And I will not choose between them,

384
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
384 I myself have plenty of them.

385
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
385 All the staves are full already,

386
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
386 Every creek is crowded with them,

387
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
387 Boats to face the gale adapted,

388
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,560
388 Boats against the wind that travel."

389
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,600
389 Then the youthful Joukahainen,

390
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,640
390 in the swamp he sang yet deeper.

391
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,680
391 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

392
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,720
392 "I have still two noble stallions;

393
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,760
393 Ay, a pair of handsome horses;

394
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,800
394 One of these of matchless swiftness,

395
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,840
395 And the other best in harness.

396
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,880
396 If it please you, choose between them."

397
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,920
397 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

398
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,960
398 "No, I do not want your horses;

399
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,000
399 Do not need your steeds, white-footed.

400
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
400 I myself have plenty of them.

401
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
401 Every stall has now its tenant,

402
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
402 Every stable's filled with horses,

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
403 With their backs like water shining;

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
404 Lakes of fat upon their haunches."

405
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
405 Then the youthful Joukahainen,

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
406 In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
407 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
408 "O thou aged Väinämöinen,

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
409 Speak thy words of magic backwards,

410
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
410 And reverse thy songs of magic.

411
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
411 I will give a golden helmet,

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
412 And a hat filled up with silver,

413
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
413 Which my father won in warfare,

414
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
414 Which he won in battle-struggle."

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
415 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

416
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
416 "No, I do not want your silver,

417
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
417 And for gold, I only scorn it.

418
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
418 I myself have both in plenty.

419
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
419 Every storeroom crammed with treasure.

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
420 Every chest is overflowing.

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
421 Gold as ancient as the moonlight,

422
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
422 Silver with the sun coeval."

423
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
423 Then the youthful Joukahainen

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
424 In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
425 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

426
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
426 "O thou aged Väinämöinen,

427
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
427 Loose me from this place of terror,

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
428 And release me from my torment.

429
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
429 All my stacks at home I'll give thee,

430
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
430 And my fields I likewise promise,

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
431 All to save my life I offer,

432
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
432 If you will accept my ransom."

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
433 Said the aged Väinämöinen,

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
434 "No, your barns I do not covet,

435
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
435 And your fields are 'neath my notice,

436
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
436 I myself have plenty of them.

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
437 Fields are mine in all directions,

438
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
438 Stocks are reared on every fallow,

439
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
439 And my own fields please me better,

440
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
440 And my stacks of corn are finest."

441
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
441 Then the youthful Joukahainen

442
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
442 In the swamp he sang yet deeper.

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
443 Then the youthful Joukahainen,

444
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
444 Felt at length the greatest anguish,

445
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
445 Chin-deep in the swamp while sinking,

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
446 In the mud his beard was draggled,

447
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
447 In the moss his mouth was sunken,

448
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
448 And his teeth among the tree-roots.

449
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
449 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
450 "O thou wisest Väinämöinen,

451
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
451 O thou oldest of magicians,

452
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
452 Sing once more thy songs of magic,

453
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
453 Grant the life of one so wretched,

454
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
454 And release me from my prison.

455
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
455 In the stream my feet are sunken,

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
456 With the sand my eyes are smarting.

457
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
457 "Speak thy words of magic backwards,

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
458 Break the spell that overwhelms me!

459
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
459 You shall have my sister Aino,

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
460 I will give my mother's daughter.

461
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
461 She shall dust your chamber for you,

462
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
462 Sweep the flooring with her besom,

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
463 Keep the milk-pots all in order;

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
464 And shall wash your garments for you.

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
465 Golden fabrics she shall weave you,

466
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
466 And shall bake you cakes of honey."

467
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
467 Then the aged Väinämöinen,

468
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
468 Heard his words, and grew full joyful,

469
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
469 Since to tend his age was promised

470
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
470 Joukahainen's lovely sister.

471
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
471 On the stone of joy he sat him,

472
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
472 On the stone of song he rested,

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
473 Sang an hour, and sang a second,

474
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
474 And again he sang a third time:

475
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
475 Thus reversed his words of magic,

476
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
476 And dissolved the spell completely.

477
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
477 Then the youthful Joukahainen

478
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
478 From the mud his chin uplifted,

479
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
479 And his beard he disentangled,

480
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
480 From the rock his steed led forward,

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
481 Drew his sledge from out the bushes,

482
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
482 From the reeds his whip unloosing.

483
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
483 Then upon his sledge he mounted,

484
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
484 And upon the seat he sat him,

485
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
485 And with gloomy thoughts he hastened,

486
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
486 With a heart all sad and doleful,

487
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
487 Homeward to his dearest mother,

488
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
488 Unto her, the aged woman.

489
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
489 On he drove with noise and tumult,

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
490 Home he drove in consternation,

491
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
491 And he broke the sledge to pieces,

492
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
492 At the door the shafts were broken.

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
493 Then the noise alarmed his mother,

494
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
494 And his father came and asked him,

495
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
495 "Recklessly the sledge was broken;

496
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
496 Did you break the shafts on purpose?

497
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
497 Wherefore do you drive so rashly,

498
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
498 And arrive at home so madly?"

499
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
499 Then the youthful Joukahainen

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
500 Could not keep his tears from flowing;

501
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,920
501 Sad he bowed his head in sorrow,

502
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,880
502 And his cap awry he shifted,

503
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
503 And his lips were dry and stiffened,

504
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,800
504 O'er his mouth his nose was drooping.

505
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
505 Then his mother came and asked him

506
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
506 Wherefore was he sunk in sorrow.

507
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,680
507 "O my son, why weep so sadly?

508
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,640
508 O my darling, why so troubled,

509
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,600
509 With thy lips so dry and stiffened,

510
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,560
510 O'er thy mouth thy nose thus drooping?"

511
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,520
511 Said the youthful Joukahainen,

512
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,480
512 "O my mother, who hast borne me,

513
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,440
513 There is cause for what has happened,

514
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,400
514 For the sorcerer has o'ercome me.

515
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,360
515 Cause enough have I for weeping,

516
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,320
516 And the sorcerer's brought me sorrow.

517
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,280
517 I myself must weep for ever,

518
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,240
518 And must pass my life in mourning,

519
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,200
519 For my very sister Aino,

520
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,160
520 She, my dearest mother's daughter,

521
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,120
521 I have pledged to Väinämöinen,

522
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
522 As the consort of the minstrel,

523
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,040
523 To support his feeble footsteps,

524
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,000
524 And to wait upon him always."

525
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,960
525 Joyous clapped her hands his mother,

526
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,920
526 Both her hands she rubbed together,

527
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,880
527 And she spoke the words which follow:

528
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
528 "Do not weep, my son, my dearest,

529
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,800
529 For thy tears are quite uncalled for.

530
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,760
530 Little cause have we to sorrow,

531
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,720
531 For the hope I long have cherished.

532
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,680
532 All my lifetime I have wished it,

533
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,640
533 And have hoped this high-born hero

534
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,600
534 Might akin to us be reckoned,

535
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,560
535 And the minstrel Väinämöinen

536
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,520
536 Might become my daughter's husband."

537
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,480
537 But when Joukahainen's sister

538
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,440
538 Heard, she wept in deepest sorrow,

539
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,400
539 Wept one day, and wept a second,

540
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,360
540 At the threshold ever weeping,

541
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,320
541 Wept in overwhelming sorrow,

542
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,280
542 In the sadness of her spirit.

543
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,240
543 Then her mother said consoling,

544
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,200
544 "Wherefore weep, my little Aino?

545
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,160
545 You have gained a valiant bridegroom,

546
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,120
546 And the home of one most noble,

547
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,080
547 Where you'll look from out the window,

548
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,040
548 Sitting on the bench and talking."

549
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,000
549 But her daughter heard and answered,

550
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,968
550 "O my mother who hast borne me,

551
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,935
551 Therefore have I cause for weeping,

552
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,903
552 Weeping for the beauteous tresses,

553
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:31,871
553 Now my youthful head adorning,

554
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,839
554 And my hair so soft and glossy,

555
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,806
555 Which must now be wholly hidden,

556
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:40,774
556 While I still am young and blooming.

557
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:43,742
557 "Then must I through lifetime sorrow

558
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,710
558 For the splendour of the sunlight,

559
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,677
559 And the moonbeam's charming lustre

560
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:52,645
560 And the glory of the heavens,

561
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:55,613
561 Which I leave, while still so youthful,

562
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,581
562 And as child must quite abandon,

563
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:01,548
563 I must leave my brother's work-room,

564
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:04,516
564 Just beyond my father's window."

565
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:07,484
565 Said the mother to the daughter,

566
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:10,452
566 To the girl the crone made answer,

567
00:30:10,452 --> 00:30:13,419
567 "Cast away this foolish sorrow,

568
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,387
568 Cease your weeping, all uncalled for,

569
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:19,355
569 Little cause have you for sorrow,

570
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:22,323
570 Little cause for lamentation.

571
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,290
571 God's bright sun is ever shining

572
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,258
572 On the world in other regions,

573
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:31,226
573 Shines on other doors and windows

574
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,194
574 Than your father's or your brother's;

575
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:37,161
575 Berries grow on every mountain,

576
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:40,129
576 Strawberries on the plains are growing,

577
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,097
577 You can pluck them in your sorrow

578
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:46,065
578 Wheresoe'er your steps may lead you;

579
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:49,032
579 Not alone on father's acres,

580
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:52,000
580 Or upon your brother's clearings."

581
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
581 Not alone on father's acres,

582
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
582 Or upon your brother's clearings."
